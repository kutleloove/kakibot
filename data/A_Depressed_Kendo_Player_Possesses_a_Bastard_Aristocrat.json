You can't even do this much.\n\nEvery day was hell.\n\nI thought about dying dozens of times a day.\n\nI endured the schedule, consumed by self-loathing and despair.\n\nBut even in such a life, I persevered.\n\nI lived.\n\nI thought everything my father did to me was for me.\n\nBecause my father loves me.\n\nMy father does this because he loves me.\n\nI comforted myself by repeating that over and over again.\n\n'If I become the best in the world, my father will smile at me again...?'\n\nWith that one thought, I endured hell.\n\nCarving myself, cutting myself, torturing myself.\n\nI embraced hope, longing for the smile that would one day grace my father's lips.\n\nHowever.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to realize that it was just my delusion.\n\nSelected as the best Kendo athlete in the Republic of Korea, I proudly joined the national team and headed towards the world championships.\n\nThere was no such thing as an opponent.\n\nCompared to the times I had endured, my opponents were too soft and lukewarm.\n\nSo I won consecutive matches, little by little.\n\nI desperately reached out for the shimmering goal that seemed both within reach and out of reach.\n\nAnd after overcoming all the hurdles, I reached the final of the World Championships.\n\nUntil I stood in the arena, I was filled with joy.\n\n'Finally, I can repay my father's love for me.'\n\nWith a faint smile, I stepped onto the final stage.\n\nMy heart pounded as I thought that the 10-year dream I had held since I was 12 years old had come true.\n\nThe dream I poured everything into.\n\nThe dream I had pursued only for my father.\n\nOn the final stage to put an end to that dream.\n\n.....I was utterly defeated.\n\nWithout even landing a single blow on my opponent.\n\nI lost with an unbelievable score of 10 to 0.\n\n-Good game. I look forward to seeing more good performances from you in the future.\n\nI remember the look in my opponent's eyes as he shook my hand after the match.\n\nA look of pity, as if looking down at a being infinitely weaker than himself.\n\nIt felt like my entire life had been negated.\n\nBut.\n\nMy misfortune didn't end there.\n\nI stumbled into the locker room, forgetting to even take off my helmet after the match.\n\nWaiting for me there was my father, staring at me with contemptuous eyes.\n\nHe remained silent for a while, then finally uttered a single sentence.\n\n-I don't understand.\n\nA voice devoid of even a shred of warmth, as if evaluating an object.\n\nWith those words, my father left the locker room.\n\nI reflexively reached out toward his retreating figure.\n\nBut I couldn't reach him.\n\nHe didn't look back at me even once as he walked down the hallway.\n\nI muttered in empty despair, looking at the emptiness before me.\n\nWhy...\n\nWhy are you leaving?\n\nI dreamed of you for 10 years.\n\nI lived for your greed for 10 years.\n\nWhy am I being abandoned so miserably now...?\n\n'I believed that you loved me.'\n\nIt was all my misunderstanding.\n\nMy father didn't love me.\n\nI collapsed, staring at his cold back.\n\nI sat there blankly, shedding tears.\n\nI had lived half my life only for my father.\n\nI realized too late that it was a false delusion.\n\nMy life had been denied.\n\nEverything I had done had been meaningless.\n\nI felt like an arrow that had lost its direction.\n\nI wanted to let go of everything.\n\nI wanted to disappear.\n\nSo I climbed the stairs.\n\nAnd now I stood here.\n\n\".....It's okay, really.\"\n\nI muttered in a pathetic voice as if to comfort myself.\n\nContradictory emotions, both fear and anticipation, overflowed with my pounding heart.\n\n[World's No. 2 Kendo Athlete, National Team Member, Commits Suicide by Jumping from a Building...]\n\n[Reportedly Suffering from Depression, Shock....]\n\nPerhaps tomorrow morning, articles like these would adorn a section of the newspaper.\n\nHaving fallen to death from a time filled with lies and delusions, I would be erased from the world along with people's meager pity.\n\n\"......\"\n\nI quietly let go of the hand that was holding onto the railing.\n\nMy precariously perched body was thrown into the air.\n\nA terrifying sense of speed and a comforting sense of buoyancy enveloped me.\n\nThe rapidly approaching ground came into view in my swirling vision.\n\nI quietly closed my eyes.\n\nAnd I prayed.\n\nPlease don't let it hurt.\n\nAnd let this be the end of everything.\n\n'Still, I'm a little scared...'\n\n-Thud!!\n\nThat was my end.\n\nAll I remember was the loud impact that struck my ears along with the intense shock.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nYes.\n\nI definitely died like that.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You have possessed 'Raiden Lishite', the eldest son of the Lishite Dukedom!]\n\n[Welcome back!]\n\nWhat is the meaning of this..."

      "content": "Regret and Opportunity\n\nA cozy feeling enveloped my entire body.\n\nWarm air flowed into my lungs with each breath I took.\n\nMy body was drained of all its strength, and my mind was hazy.\n\nIt felt like I was swimming in a warm bath.\n\n'This is... death.'\n\nMy last memory was of throwing myself off the roof of a building.\n\nI fell from the 20th floor of an apartment building, so I must be dead for sure.\n\nI exhaled, stretching myself out in the cozy sensation.\n\n'It's soft... and fluffy...'\n\nIs this what they call the embrace of death?\n\nTo think that I'm only feeling this peace, which I haven't felt even once in the past 10 years since I first held a sword, after death.\n\nIt left a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.\n\n'It was really so hard...'\n\nIt doesn't matter anymore.\n\nBecause the death I longed for so much has come to me.\n\nDeath is an endless sleep.\n\nEternal rest that will lead me to a world of dreams.\n\nThe hellish days I endured every day.\n\nMy father's cold words and gaze.\n\nThe image of myself desperately struggling to be loved.\n\nNone of it exists anymore.\n\nBecause I'm dead.\n\nI don't have to do anything anymore.\n\nJust indulge in the endless sleep and enjoy the peaceful rest...\n\n'.....Huh?'\n\nAs I lay there, I tilted my head at the sudden sense of incongruity.\n\nI had clearly died, but...\n\nHow am I 'thinking'?\n\nMy brain must have turned to mush after falling from that height.\n\n'How is this possible...?'\n\nAt the same time as that question arose in my mind.\n\nI felt my hazy consciousness becoming clearer.\n\nAnd soon after, a pain like my head was splitting open struck my brain.\n\nWith that terrible sensation, I sat up abruptly from my lying position and groaned.\n\n\"Ugh, uhk...!?\"\n\nIt hurt so much.\n\nIt felt like my skull was shattering, and its contents were spilling out.\n\nAs I held my forehead for a moment due to the pain, I soon frowned, noticing something strange.\n\nMy head, which should have been shattered, was... perfectly intact.\n\nMy fingertips felt my messy hair.\n\nNo matter how much I fumbled, there were no injuries.\n\n\"......?\"\n\nThat wasn't the only strange thing.\n\nAn even more incomprehensible sight unfolded before my eyes.\n\nTrees that reached as high as the sky.\n\nLight green leaves rustled whenever the wind blew.\n\nThe vast sky was visible beyond the trees, and the fragrant scent of grass tickled my nose.\n\nI stared blankly at it all and muttered.\n\n\"A forest...?\"\n\nYes, it was a forest.\n\nTo my bewilderment, I was currently lying in the middle of a forest.\n\nQuestions, bewilderment, and a sense of incongruity swirled in my head.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nHave I finally gone mad?\n\nOr have I come to the afterlife after my head was smashed from the fall?\n\nAs I looked around, lost in thought.\n\nAn unfamiliar mechanical sound rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You have possessed 'Raiden Lishite', the eldest son of the Duke Lishite family!]\n\n[Welcome back!]\n\nAt the same time, a light blue screen appeared before my eyes.\n\nWhat is commonly called a 'status window' in the world appeared in the air.\n\nSeeing that sight, I was able to grasp the situation belatedly.\n\n\"So...\"\n\nDamn it.\n\nI've finally lost it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMaybe this is also a form of mental illness.\n\nSuffering from depression and obsession, I finally went over the edge.\n\nThis situation is all my delusion.\n\nMy body in reality is probably a cold corpse, growing colder.\n\nThere's that possibility, isn't there?\n\nLike a flashback you experience right before death.\n\nIt could be that I'm dreaming due to some strange activity in my brain.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You are alive.]\n\n[This is reality, and you are currently in a state of possessing 'Raiden Lishite'.]\n\nHow can I believe that?\n\nIt would be more realistic to say that I failed my suicide attempt and am in a coma.\n\n......Of course, considering the height I fell from, even that seems impossible.\n\nAt least it's more realistic than this absurd situation.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You have possessed 'Raiden Lishite'.]\n\n[Congratulations on your return.]\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nIn the end.\n\nIt took me quite a while to accept this reality.\n\nThe status window kept insisting that I was fine.\n\nI told it to shut up and ignored it several times.\n\nA fierce battle with no room for compromise.\n\nIn the end, it was I who surrendered.\n\nIf this is a delusion or a dream, there would be no such thing as pain.\n\nI tried breaking my pinky finger with the intention of testing it.\n\nWith a cracking sound, excruciating pain shot through me.\n\n\"Ahhk...?!\"\n\nAt that point, I couldn't help but believe it.\n\nAll five senses were responding, my mind was clear, and the pain was working properly.\n\nNot facing the situation properly at this point was nothing but escapism.\n\n-Always keep your mind sharp.\n\n-It's important to read the sword path calmly, without thinking that what you know is all there is to the world.\n\nMy father's teachings briefly came to mind, but I shook my head.\n\nEven my father wouldn't have heard of a situation like this.\n\nAs I held my throbbing hand, lost in thought, the blue window popped up again.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Self-harm is not good.]\n\n[Excessive self-destructive tendencies can lead to mental disorders and suicidal urges.]\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nI'm in a body that has already committed suicide.\n\nWhy should I care about preserving it?\n\nBesides, I've experienced the pain of broken bones many times in my previous life.\n\nIt's a sensation you never get used to, no matter how many times you go through it...\n\nWell, thanks to that, I was able to recognize more clearly that this situation is real.\n\nIt was fine.\n\n\"It's just one finger.\"\n\n-Ding!\n\n[User's mental state confirmed to be abnormal.]\n\n[Developing countermeasures according to basic guidelines for symptoms of depression, including mental illness......]\n\nI looked at the status window, chattering to itself.\n\nI no longer thought this was my dream or delusion.\n\nBut that didn't mean I wasn't bewildered by the current situation.\n\n\"A status window... something you only see in novels.\"\n\nI tapped on the translucent screen.\n\nThe blunt font characters blinked on it.\n\nThe name 'Raiden Lishite', which had been emphasized repeatedly.\n\nIt was a very familiar name.\n\nBecause he was one of the characters in my favorite novel.\n\n\"Possession...\"\n\nThe outline began to become clear.\n\nIsn't it just like the stories in common novels?\n\nThe protagonist, who has faced death, receives a new opportunity in the form of possession, a classic storyline.\n\nA popular beginning that everyone would enjoy.\n\nHowever, the difference between them in the book and me is......\n\n\"......Why am I caught up in this again?\"\n\nI had no will to live left.\n\nThe dream I had longed for all my life had crumbled.\n\nI was abandoned by the person I wanted to be loved by.\n\nAll the people around me who treated me kindly met their downfall because of me.\n\n\"I didn't need this kind of opportunity.\"\n\nI was just so tired.\n\nI just wanted to disappear quietly.\n\nNow it's even preventing me from dying.\n\nHow much more broken and miserable do I have to be to find peace?\n\nThe sorrow buried deep inside began to seep out.\n\nLethargy, despair, emptiness.\n\nThey all approached me as if they had a physical form.\n\nRough emotions struck my face and choked me, but I didn't resist.\n\nYes.\n\nLet it break my neck once more.\n\nSo that this hateful sound of breathing and the noise of the world no longer ring in my ears.\n\nLet the curtain fall on the stage of my life.\n\n\"......\"\n\nOverwhelmed by melancholy, I quietly closed my eyes.\n\nAnd I stuck out my tongue.\n\nSuicide was hard the first time, the second time shouldn't be difficult.\n\nI comforted myself by repeating that.\n\nJust as my teeth were about to sever the thread of life once more.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[I can fulfill your wish.]"

What should I do...?'\n\nAs I panicked,\n\nThe mechanical sound, which I was getting used to, rang in my ears once again.\n\nAt the same time, a blue window appeared in front of me.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Synchronization, a possession perk, is starting!]\n\n[Synchronization]\n\nThe user's memories will be synchronized with Raiden Lishite's.\n\nYou will inherit all the memories that Raiden Lishite experienced.\n\n[※Warning※]\n\nYou may experience dizziness due to the vast amount of memories and emotional overflow.\n\nYou may experience status ailments such as fainting, vomiting, or mental instability due to the shock.\n\nOnly memories are transferred through the possession perk.

Let's go together!\n\n-Young Master! You need to take your books!!\n\n-Even though it's an arranged engagement, I think I'm okay with it...\n\n-Correct again! Excellent, student Raiden!\n\nVoices and scenes flashed by like a fast-forwarded film.\n\nThey were scenes I had never experienced in my life, voices I had never heard before.\n\nThese were Raiden Lishite's memories...\n\n\"Ugh...!!\"\n\n\"Y-Young Master...?\"\n\nThe pain intensified as more memories flowed in.\n\nMy whole body trembled with a bizarre sensation as if the top of my head had been opened and my brain was being stirred.\n\n-......I'm disappointed, Raiden.\n\n-Brother... Why have you changed so much?\n\n-Y-Young Master......\n\n-Forget about the engagement. I don't love you anymore.\n\n-Harassing commoner students again. This is a warning, student Raiden.\n\nThe voices that were warm just a moment ago gradually turned cold.\n\nAt the same time, my heart raced, and my chest ached.\n\nA sharp, painful emotion washed over me.\n\nGuilt, lethargy, despair, all mixed together to form a familiar pain.\n\nIs this emotion... what my body, Raiden, is feeling...?\n\nWait a minute. The status window definitely said something earlier...\n\nI couldn't remember.\n\nOnly a dizzying headache dominated my mind.\n\nIt felt like my head was going to explode.\n\n\"Ugh! Aaagh!!\"\n\n\"Young Master!\"\n\nA scream escaped my lips.\n\nEven though the transfer of memories had ended, the ringing in my head showed no signs of stopping.\n\nAmplified by Raiden's emotions, the memories infected me, reflecting the past.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You are afflicted with the status ailment (Trauma) due to the backlash of memory transfer!]\n\n-\"Kim Naru, national team representative?

Seriously, even I could do better lol\"\n\nThe comments from the finals video, filled with mockery and malice, turned into voices that pierced my ears.\n\nWords that denied, ridiculed, and belittled my life pierced my heart.\n\nAs I gasped for breath with a constricted throat,\n\nThe nightmare of that day replayed once again.\n\n-\"I don't understand.\"\n\nMy father's voice.\n\nA cold voice, devoid of any warmth.\n\nI couldn't breathe.\n\nMy throat felt choked, as if my lungs were refusing to take in air.\n\n\"Gasp, cough...!\"\n\nJust as my vision blurred,\n\nA clear mechanical sound pierced through everything and reached me.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Skill 'Iron Will' resists the status ailment (Trauma)!]\n\n[Status ailment (Trauma) is nullified!]\n\n\"Cough...!

Huff...\"\n\nAs the ringing in my head disappeared, my rigid breathing returned.\n\nMy vision felt a bit clearer, but my body was still twitching and convulsing.\n\nThat chilling sensation made my mind go blank.\n\nAs I gasped for breath, trying to calm my pounding heart, the maid who was clinging to me leaned in.\n\n\"Young Master...! What's wrong with you all of a sudden...!!\"\n\nShe was panicking, probably because she saw me gasping for air.\n\nShe looked so cute, not knowing what to do and shedding tears.\n\nI quietly reached out and wiped the girl's cheeks.\n\n\"Young... Master?\"\n\nTo calm her down, I called her name softly.\n\n\"Calm down, Rachel.\"\n\nRachel.\n\nThe maid who had been by Raiden's side since childhood.\n\nThe loyal retainer who remained devoted even after Raiden became a delinquent.\n\nAnd my precious... friend.\n\n\"Young Master...?\"\n\n\"Yes, Rachel. I'm here. I'm back...\"\n\nAt those words, the girl burst into tears once more.\n\nWith a complicated heart, I gazed at the watery trails running down her face.\n\nHowever, my melancholic gaze was cut short.\n\nA sudden blue screen appeared, blocking the space between her and me.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Due to extreme mental exhaustion, you are entering the status ailment (Faint).]\n\n\"Wait, what...?\"\n\nThis damn...\n\nThud.

No, Mother...\n\nWhen Raiden turned sixteen.\n\nHis mother passed away.\n\nThe cause of death was assassination.\n\nIt happened on a quiet winter night.\n\nAfter finishing his daily routine, Raiden was lying in bed.\n\nHe heard occasional creaking sounds from outside the window, but the exhausted boy dismissed them as his imagination.\n\nHe shouldn't have.\n\n-Crash!!\n\nThe window shattered with a sharp noise.\n\nAs Raiden sat up in surprise, unidentified assailants barged into his room.\n\nShadows approached with a chilling aura, drawing their swords from their waists.\n\nThe boy, too shocked by the situation, froze in place.\n\n-If you come quietly, we won't kill you.\n\nJust as the black hands reached out to Raiden.\n\nA woman with red hair suddenly appeared, blocking their path.\n\n-Run, Raiden!!\n\nBlue magic flickered from her delicate fingertips.\n\nThe next moment, a surge of magic pushed Raiden's body towards the door.\n\nIn less than a second.\n\nThe boy saw it.\n\nHis mother, forcing a clumsy smile towards him with trembling lips.\n\nAnd several swords protruding from her stomach.\n\n-I'm... sorry... My... son...\n\n-M... Mother...?\n\nThe memories after that were hazy.\n\nThe boy simply stood still.\n\nHis father arrived late and slaughtered the assassins who were laughing.\n\nEven as the shocked butler shook the boy's shoulders, asking if he was alright.\n\nThe boy just stared at his mother's rapidly cooling body.\n\nIt was the first death the boy had ever encountered in his life.\n\nAnd his first farewell, faced without any preparation.\n\nThe death of the person he had relied on most since childhood came as a tremendous shock.\n\nAnd that shock severely distorted his mental state.\n\n-Mother... M-Mom, because of me...\n\nThe boy was tormented by the fact that his mother died saving him.\n\nThe person he loved, sacrificed herself for him, out of love for him.\n\nThose horrible thoughts gradually broke the boy down.\n\nTo forget the vivid memories of that day etched in his mind, he lived every day drowning himself in alcohol.\n\nHis judgment became increasingly clouded as he spent all day intoxicated.\n\n-It's all... It's all my fault...\n\n-If Mother hadn't loved me, this wouldn't have happened...\n\n-......I should have died instead.\n\nFoolish boy.\n\nHe was still young and didn't know how to properly overcome his wounds.\n\nHis mind was too overwhelmed to think straight.\n\nHis mother's sincere devotion and sacrifice were too much for the boy to bear.\n\nThis became the first reason why Raiden feared being loved by others.\n\nAnd soon, it settled in his heart as a kind of obsession.\n\nFrom then on, the boy rejected the love of others.\n\nHe didn't try to give love to others like before, nor did he try to receive it.\n\nInstead, he did all sorts of evil deeds to be hated and despised.\n\n-You can't even do this properly?!\n\n-This food tastes awful!!\n\nHe hurled insults at the servants of the mansion.\n\n-Hic... Stop telling me to stop drinking... Damn it, what business is it of yours, Father!!\n\nHe drank every day, ruining his own behavior.\n\n-Hey there, pretty lady? How about spending the night with me...\n\nAt the academy, he relentlessly flirted with female students.\n\n-This class is so boring.\n\n-How dare a mere academy professor lecture me?! You must want to die!?\n\nHe would always cause trouble during class.\n\nAs obsession and trauma consumed his mind, Raiden's delinquent behavior only worsened.\n\nOf course, perhaps because his heart was inherently soft, he couldn't commit truly evil acts like violence or murder.\n\nHowever, it was enough to earn the world's hatred.\n\nRumors about Raiden started from the academy and gradually grew in size.\n\nAnd as they grew, various rumors and falsehoods were mixed in.\n\nThe boy had never slept with a woman, but rumors spread that he lived a promiscuous and debauched life.\n\nHe had never laid a hand on anyone, but stories circulated that he habitually assaulted servants.\n\nThe fact that the Duke's eldest son was a delinquent was such a sensational topic for gossip.\n\nRumors about the boy spread like wildfire.\n\nRaiden was satisfied with that.\n\nFar from trying to stop the rumors, he focused on fueling them.\n\nHe spent money and used people to deliberately create negative public opinion about himself.\n\nAnd whenever the reactions died down, he continued to put on flamboyant performances.\n\n-I shouldn't be loved, I don't deserve it...\n\n-......I'm a monster who survived by drinking my mother's blood.\n\n-I don't want to make anyone who loves me... unhappy again...\n\nThe boy muttered to himself every night like a madman.\n\nHis thoughts and reason were already consumed by self-loathing.\n\nAnd every action he took was deeply ingrained with obsession.\n\n-......I miss you, Mother.\n\nHe was a foolish boy of seventeen.\n\nRaiden continued his delinquent behavior, spending each day in turmoil.\n\nAs more time passed, he turned eighteen.\n\nThe delinquent met a student at the academy.\n\nAllen Reinhardt.\n\nThe boy who was considered the most talented among the first-year students at the academy.\n\nAnd the protagonist of the novel 'Sorrow-erasing Heroes'.\n\nHe threw his glove at Raiden, who was harassing female students as usual, and said,\n\n-\"I challenge you to a duel, senior. Stop bothering my friends and fight me.\"\n\nRaiden accepted the challenge with a smile in his heart.\n\nThis was an opportunity to be hated and ridiculed even more, so there was no reason to refuse.\n\nThe boy even felt gratitude towards Allen as he entered the duel.\n\nAnd that day, Raiden was brutally beaten in front of countless spectators.\n\nThe male students who watched the duel laughed mockingly, finding it satisfying.\n\nThe female students gazed at Allen with admiration.\n\nAllen frowned and said to Raiden,\n\n-Originally, I was going to demand your expulsion from the academy as compensation for the duel... but I'll let it slide.\n\n-But please keep this in mind.\n\n-Never appear in front of me or my friends again.\n\nAfter the duel, Raiden returned to his dormitory.\n\nFamiliar emptiness and darkness greeted him.\n\nThe boy trudged along, quietly sinking to the floor in his empty room.\n\nThe wounds stung fiercely.\n\nBut it was okay.\n\nNo one worried about him.\n\nBut it was okay.\n\nEveryone glared at him with contempt.\n\nBut it was okay.\n\n-......\n\nNo.\n\nWas it... really okay...?\n\nHe felt a sorrow tinged with despair.\n\nHe felt a pain stabbing his chest.\n\nHe felt an incredibly desolate loneliness.\n\nBut he quietly comforted himself.\n\n-It's okay, I'm doing well...\n\n-It's okay... It'll be okay...\n\nHe muttered to himself, forcing a smile as he tried to sleep.\n\nHis broken mind was like a truck with a broken steering wheel.\n\nUnable to change direction even though he knew he was on the wrong path.\n\nA frantic race.\n\nThe boy's downfall eventually led him to ruin.\n\nA few days after the duel,\n\nRaiden's younger sister, who had entered the academy as a first-year student, came to find him.\n\nShe seemed furious, having heard about the duel with Allen.\n\nThe girl shouted at the boy,\n\n-\"Why! Why are you doing this! I asked you to just stay quiet!!\"\n\nHis cute and gentle younger sister had transformed into a sharp and cold figure.\n\nRaiden felt a slight bitterness at that.\n\nBut he didn't show it and simply reacted with his usual nonchalant attitude.\n\nThe girl was exhausted by Raiden's behavior.\n\nShe felt she could no longer wait for her kind and warm brother from the past.\n\nPerhaps that was why?\n\nWords that she would never normally utter escaped her lips.\n\n-\"I wish... that day, you had died instead of Mom...\"\n\nRaiden froze at those words."

Father!\n\nA friendly smile and thoughtful actions.\n\nAn altruistic and warm heart.\n\nRaiden in the past was a child who made it impossible for those around him not to love him.\n\nHis witty words always made others smile.\n\nHis considerate actions touched people's hearts.\n\nHis warm heart, which melted away gloomy atmospheres, even became a driving force for some to live.\n\nThe power to make people smile.\n\nThe power to draw people in.\n\nAnd the power to embrace people in his heart.\n\nIt was a realm that couldn't be achieved with mere swords or magic.\n\nThat's why Steiner was truly proud of Raiden.\n\nBecause his son was born with the true qualities of a human being that he had always envisioned.\n\nSteiner believed that his proud son would always grow up upright.\n\nBut...\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nAnother sigh echoed through the Duke's office.\n\nA single bud of compassion bloomed in the cold Duke's heart.\n\nThat pitiful flower was, of course, for his son.\n\nSteiner vividly remembered.\n\nThe pain of the day his wife, Philippa Lishite, was buried.\n\nThe sorrow of losing a loved one.\n\nIt was an unbearable pain even for the Empire's greatest pyromancer, once known as the 'Flame Emperor'.\n\nHis young son had experienced that pain.\n\nHe had even witnessed the horrific sight of his mother being brutally murdered right before his eyes.\n\n...Yes, if only that had been all.\n\nThe problem was that it didn't end there.\n\n\"I shouldn't have done that back then...\"\n\nOverwhelmed with guilt, Steiner rubbed his face.\n\nRaindrops of self-reproach and self-loathing fell on the fading petals of compassion.\n\n-...I'm sorry, Philippa.\n\nSteiner had to conceal his wife's death from the public.\n\nIt had been less than ten years since the Empire had forcibly ended the civil war.\n\nIf word got out that the Duchess of the Lishite family, the sword of the Empire and its greatest force, had been assassinated,\n\nit would undoubtedly create unrest both within and outside the Empire.\n\nNot only would the Lishite family's standing be damaged,\n\nbut the authority of the Imperial family they protected would also be threatened.\n\nSteiner had no choice.\n\n-I'm so... so sorry...\n\nThe incompetent husband apologized to his wife countless times, muttering those words.\n\nHowever, contrary to his torn heart, the cover-up proceeded smoothly.\n\nFortunately, or unfortunately,\n\nonly his son, the head butler, and a few trusted retainers had witnessed the scene that day.\n\nSteiner thoroughly silenced them and only informed those who needed to know.\n\nThe Emperor and the Crown Prince.\n\nThe other Dukes.\n\nHis family members, including his son and daughter.\n\nThe head butler and a few trusted retainers.\n\nOnly about ten people in the Empire knew the truth about Philippa Lishite's death.\n\n-Oh, Duke! I heard your wife has been unwell lately. Is she alright?\n\n-Thank you for your concern, Marquis. Philippa's health has been quite poor... She hasn't been able to attend any social gatherings.\n\n-Oh my... We'll send someone from our family to visit her when she's feeling better.\n\n-Ah, there's no need for that. Her physician advised her to avoid contact with outsiders as much as possible.\"\n\n-I see, I hope she recovers soon... I'll let the others know in advance.\n\n-Yes, please do. Everyone will be wondering why she's absent from social gatherings.\n\nSteiner fabricated false rumors to delay the announcement of his wife's death.\n\nThus, the story of the Duchess of the Lishite family being assassinated was concealed,\n\nand only rumors of her being critically ill circulated within the Empire.\n\n-Are you... sure you have to go this far...?\n\n-You know, Your Majesty. If we announce Philippa's death without any preparation, we won't be able to avoid the suspicions of those damn Seekers.\n\n-......I understand. With the Imperial authority still unstable, it would be much safer to announce it after shaping public opinion to some extent. It would also be better if the cause of death was illness rather than assassination.\n\n-Indeed.\n\n-Sigh... But this isn't right, is it? I hear your son is out of his mind these days.\n\n-I apologize.\n\n-It's alright... Just take care of your son. That kind child wouldn't be acting like a delinquent if it weren't for something serious.\n\nHowever, despite the Emperor's advice, Steiner couldn't focus on Raiden.\n\nWhile the father was busy eliminating Seeker branches and covering up his wife's death,\n\nhis son transformed into a delinquent with even more sinister rumors surrounding him.\n\nTime passed.\n\nOn the day Philippa Lishite's fabricated death was announced to the world,\n\nSteiner finally saw it.\n\n-......\n\nHis son's eyes, staring blankly at his mother's grave,\n\nas if he had lost something precious.\n\nOnly then did Steiner realize.\n\nHe should have put aside everything, the Empire and all,\n\nand embraced his wounded child.\n\nHe had believed that his son, who had always done well, would overcome this too.\n\n-......Raiden.\n\n-Don't worry about me, Father.\n\nBut regret couldn't change anything.\n\nThe boy was already broken.\n\nHis cheerful smile had turned into a mocking one.\n\nHis words, which used to bring joy to everyone, now brought tears and anger.\n\nHis once warm heart was now submerged beneath the surface, cold and distant.\n\nSteiner tried to reach out to his son countless times, but\n\nRaiden pushed him away each time.\n\nAs if he was deliberately isolating himself.\n\nSo Steiner decided to wait.\n\nFor his wounded child to return whenever he was ready.\n\nHe knew he had done something unforgivable, but\n\nhe was still willing to be there for his son, if the boy still considered him his father.\n\nHowever...\n\nOne month.\n\nThree months.\n\nSix months.\n\nOne year.\n\nEven after a year, Raiden showed no signs of returning to his former self.\n\nSteiner realized.\n\nThat Raiden was broken beyond repair.\n\nThe father, learning of his son's condition, tried to restrain him by any means necessary.\n\nHe didn't want his child to be hated by others anymore.\n\nBut despite his efforts, Raiden didn't change.\n\nNo, he became even more malicious.\n\nThe distance between father and son grew wider.\n\n-What...? Raiden's gone?\n\nAnd then, a year and a half after Raiden became a delinquent,\n\nhe suddenly disappeared.\n\nAt first, Steiner wasn't worried.\n\nSimilar things had happened before.\n\nHe thought his son had simply gone somewhere to clear his head.\n\nA week passed.\n\nTwo weeks passed.\n\nA month passed.\n\nRaiden still hadn't appeared.\n\nOnly then did Steiner realize that something was wrong and began searching for him.\n\nHe searched the restaurants and shops Raiden frequented.\n\nThe places he loved as a child.\n\nThe places he might have gone to at the academy.\n\nBut he couldn't find him.\n\nAnother month passed.\n\nTwo months passed.\n\nThree months passed.\n\nEven after four months since Raiden's disappearance, no one had seen him.\n\nAs anxiety gnawed at him,\n\nalmost six months after his disappearance, Raiden reappeared.\n\nCovered in wounds and looking a mess."

Those words just slipped out unconsciously...\"\n\n\"It's okay, Ray.\"\n\nI forced my trembling voice to steady.\n\nDamn it, it's not even my trauma, why am I shaking...?\n\nIt seemed Raiden's emotions were still deeply embedded in this body.\n\n\"Young Master? Aren't you going in?\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nLost in thought,\n\nI had arrived at the door of the Duke's office without realizing it.\n\nI took a few deep breaths to compose myself and carefully knocked on the door.\n\n-Knock, knock\n\n\"Father, it's me.\"\n\n-Come in.\n\nI swallowed nervously and grabbed the doorknob.\n\n-Click, creak...\n\nAs the hinges screamed, Rachel and I entered the room.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the desk cluttered with all sorts of documents.\n\nAnd sitting in front of that desk was a man with black hair and black eyes.\n\nSteiner Lishite.\n\nThe war hero who ended the Empire's civil war ten years ago.\n\nThe first Executor of Blue Talent, considered the greatest pyromancer of the current era.\n\nAnd the person young Raiden admired and aspired to be the most.\n\nHe looked rather gentle now with his tired face and simple shirt, but\n\nI could feel it from the aura that filled the room.\n\nHow formidable a person he was.\n\nAs I bit my lip slightly, feeling a cold sweat break out from the intimidating atmosphere,\n\nSteiner, who had put down the document he was reading, looked at me.\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nHis black eyes were calm and deep.\n\nAs our gazes met, the tension that had been building up to its peak vanished like a lie.\n\nA mixture of melancholy and relief washed over me, tickling my heart.\n\nHmm... It was a strange feeling.\n\nFor Raiden, Steiner was a figure of both admiration and sorrow,\n\nwhile for me, the existence of a father was one of hatred and fear.\n\nConflicting emotions clashed, leaving a lukewarm sensation that dampened my chest.\n\n\"Yes, Father. I'm back.\"\n\nTo his simple question, I gave an equally simple answer.\n\nI had to keep my lips tightly sealed, lest Raiden's face break into a beaming smile at the slightest lapse in concentration.\n\n'......He really loved his father, huh.'\n\nAs I tried my best to keep my expression neutral to control my emotions,\n\nSteiner, who had been staring at me blankly, finally composed himself and spoke again.\n\n\"Were you off causing trouble in some strange place again?\"\n\nNo.\n\nThis guy fell off a cliff and died, and I'm just borrowing his body for a while due to certain circumstances.\n\n...Of course, I couldn't say that, so I just nodded vaguely.\n\nSteiner's eyes widened slightly, as if surprised by my docile response.\n\nThe original 'delinquent' Raiden would have acted arrogantly and talked back to Steiner.\n\nHe seemed quite taken aback by my unexpected behavior.\n\n\"Ahem...\"\n\nSteiner cleared his throat and regained his composure.\n\n\"So, where have you been and what have you been doing for the past six months?\"\n\n\"Just... living.\"\n\nNo, really.\n\nThis body was dead for six months, so what could he have possibly done?\n\n\"......\"\n\nSteiner stared at me intently with a complicated expression.\n\nBoth Rachel and Steiner made this kind of expression whenever they looked at me.\n\nWell... Raiden was a troubled kid, after all.\n\n\"......So, what about the academy?\"\n\n\"The academy?\"\n\n\"You are a student, are you not?

Whether you want to go back to the academy or not. If you do, you won't be able to live like a delinquent anymore. If you miss even a single day, you'll be expelled...\"\n\n\"I'll attend.\"\n\n\"Yes... I thought so. Then, you'll quit the academy and start working for the family...

Huff...\"\n\nIt was the most intense reaction I had experienced so far.\n\nWell, it was understandable from Raiden's perspective.\n\nSkill number 3, 'Short-Range Teleportation (Blink)'.\n\nIt was the monstrous skill that had devoured Raiden's mother.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn the world of the novel 'Sorrow-erasing heroes', people born with the talent for spatial magic were extremely rare.\n\nYou could barely find one or two in the entire continent.\n\nOf course, mages who reached the pinnacle could forcibly distort coordinates and teleport, but it required incredibly complex chanting, calculations, and an extremely inefficient amount of mana.\n\nThere was even a saying among mages, \"It's more reasonable to run to your destination than to teleport.\"\n\nHowever, this was the story of ordinary people.\n\nThose born with the inherent talent for teleportation were different.\n\nThey could teleport without any restrictions or delays as long as they had enough mana.\n\nIn some ways, it was a talent valued even more highly than the talent for manipulating time, so it was natural for them to attract attention.\n\nThe world called them 'Those Blessed by Space' and praised their genius.\n\n-Oh my... The young master of the Lishite family's inherent talent is spatial magic...?\n\n-Goodness, it seems a genius who will dominate the era has been born.\n\nAnd Raiden was one of those 'Blessed by Space'.\n\nThe boy was born with the 'Short-Range Teleportation' magic as his inherent talent.\n\nThe entire continent was in an uproar.\n\nThe Lishite family, already known for their powerful martial prowess as the sword of the Empire, was now about to produce a 'spatial mage', a talent so rare.\n\nSome looked upon him with interest and admiration, while others harbored jealousy and hatred.\n\nHowever, the commotion didn't last long."

      "content": "The reason lay in Raiden's magic.\n\nIt was true that he could freely teleport and fly through space.\n\nThe problem was...\n\n-Uh... Young Master? Did you just use your talent...?\n\n-Yes! I used it to its fullest extent!\n\n...The maximum distance he could teleport was a mere one meter.\n\nUsually, when people talk about short-range teleportation, it means being able to teleport at least 50 meters, up to 300 meters.\n\nBut Raiden's maximum teleportation distance was exactly one meter.\n\nIt was an absurdly disappointing number.\n\nOn top of that, his innate mana capacity was smaller than that of ordinary people, so he could only use it about ten times.\n\nAs soon as it was revealed that the child who had received the continent's expectations was a dud, interest in Raiden quickly faded.\n\nExcept for one group.\n\n'The Seekers.'\n\nA group of mages driven by madness, who conducted all sorts of inhumane experiments on people with unique talents in the name of pursuing the truth of magic.\n\nThey also served as one of the main villains in the story.\n\nAnyway, to continue the story, from the Seekers' perspective, Raiden must have seemed like a mouthwatering test subject.\n\nHe was born with the rarest talent on the continent, and unlike ordinary spatial mages who had a high chance of escaping after being captured, he was a target they could experiment on to their heart's content once caught.\n\nOf course, his status as the eldest son of the Duke's family was a slight obstacle, but the eyes of the mad mages were already bloodshot.\n\nSo the Seekers devised a crazy plan to infiltrate the Lishite family mansion, and using all sorts of magic tools and blood-soaked talents, they almost succeeded...\n\n-Run, Raiden!!\n\n...But their plan was foiled by the sudden intervention of the Duchess and the Duke, who arrived later.\n\nThe Seekers, who ended up killing the innocent Duchess, incurred the wrath of Duke Lishite.\n\nAs a full-scale crackdown on the Seekers began.\n\nThe Seekers, sensing danger, retreated and hid in various parts of the continent.\n\n\"The Seekers...\"\n\nThey were a disturbing group even when I read about them in the novel, but now they seemed like nothing but bastards.\n\nIf they were pursuing the truth of magic, why weren't they researching formulas instead of conducting human experiments?\n\nAnd why were they committing acts of terrorism like kidnapping and murder?\n\n\"...Poor Raiden.\"\n\nAnyway.\n\nFor this reason, Raiden's inherent talent, 'Short-Range Teleportation', was like a sensitive spot for him.\n\nJudging from the anger and resentment boiling within me, it seemed that was still the case.\n\nDon't worry, Raiden.\n\nThe Seekers will be wiped out within five years anyway.\n\nBy our protagonist.\n\n'Speaking of which...'\n\nHe has no skills whatsoever.\n\nUsually, everyone has at least 'Basic Swordsmanship' or 'Basic Magic'.\n\nRaiden had no talent for martial arts, so... did he deliberately avoid developing any skills?\n\nWell, just looking at his average physical stat of E+, it was obvious.\n\nThis guy had never trained a day in his life.\n\n\"You need to exercise to be healthy...\"\n\nWell, those were hypocritical words coming from me.\n\nUsually, people don't call getting beaten to a pulp until you're covered in blood 'exercise'.\n\nThat's called abuse.\n\nI chuckled bitterly, muttering to myself.\n\n\"Both Raiden and I... we've had shitty lives.\"\n\nDespite everything, I felt a strong sense of kinship with him.\n\nThe boy who lost his mother at sixteen.\n\nRaiden.\n\nAnd me, who lost my mother at eleven.\n\nKim Naru.\n\nWe faced different types of pain and circumstances, but we were both bastards who survived at the cost of our mothers' lives.\n\nA sense of camaraderie as fellow unfilial sons.\n\n\"But I'm a little envious.\"\n\nHaving a loving family is a blessing.\n\nObjectively speaking, Raiden's family was more than he deserved.\n\nBoth his sister and his father, they never gave up on him until the very end.\n\nMoreover, they both seemed to feel guilty for failing to prevent Raiden's downfall.\n\nThey might have been clumsy, but no one could deny that they loved the boy.\n\n\"......\"\n\nAt least the people Raiden loved stayed by his side until the end.\n\nThe people I loved always died or left for places I couldn't reach.\n\nFor a moment, I felt a surge of slimy emotions like jealousy and contempt, but I firmly pushed them away.\n\nNo matter how selfish I was, I wasn't so wicked as to envy a story that had already ended in tragedy.\n\n\"......Everything will be alright.\"\n\nI muttered those words.\n\nIt was both a suggestion to myself and a message to Raiden.\n\nDon't worry.\n\nWe'll be okay.\n\nWe can do well this second time around.\n\nI whispered those words in my heart and turned my gaze towards the window.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe carriage traveled, we spent the nights at inns, and the days repeated: riding the carriage, staying at inns.\n\nAfter a week of this monotonous yet peaceful journey, we finally reached our destination.\n\n\"Oh my goodness! Young Master...! Look outside! It's huge!!\"\n\nRachel exclaimed, seemingly amazed by the sight of the academy beyond the window.\n\nWell, it was understandable.\n\nEven I, who had seen it through Raiden's memories, was speechless at the sight.\n\nI chuckled at the girl's pure reaction.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I get it. Now sit down. What if you get hurt?\"\n\n\"It's okay! I'm always practicing my balance to become the perfect servant...! Whoa?!\"\n\nAs Rachel boasted confidently, wiggling her lips, the carriage, which had been moving steadily, came to an abrupt stop.\n\nThe sudden halt sent Rachel tumbling forward, and I instinctively reached out and caught her in my arms.\n\n\"Huh...?\"\n\n\"See? I told you to be careful.\"\n\nThe girl, who had been looking up at me from my embrace, blushed and quickly pulled away.\n\nIt was a similar reaction to when she woke up on my lap before.\n\nI flicked her forehead lightly as she sat back in her seat.\n\n-Flick!\n\n\"Ouch...!\"\n\n\"You should sit still from now on, right?\"\n\n\"Ugh... Yes...\"\n\nSatisfied with her obedient response, I nodded.\n\nThe carriage had come to a complete stop, signaling the end of our long journey.\n\nI gazed out the window at the scenery.\n\nThe imposing main gate of the academy, exuding an overwhelming sense of grandeur.\n\nBeyond it lay a cluster of buildings, seemingly the size of a small city.\n\n\"We're here.\"\n\nThe stage of the novel 'Sorrow-erasing heroes', and the place where Raiden had spent his time until six months ago.\n\nWe had finally arrived at Reynolds Academy."

I'll be quiet this time.\"\n\nGilbert's eyes widened at my words.\n\nThe calm old man's face was filled with shock and confusion.\n\nIt was understandable.\n\nThe nickname \"Gramps\" was a term of endearment between Raiden and Gilbert.\n\nGilbert called Raiden \"Little Master,\" and Raiden called Gilbert \"Gramps.\"\n\nIt was a nickname that Raiden hadn't used since he changed.\n\nGilbert had a nostalgic look on his face.\n\nI smiled at him once more and turned around to leave.\n\nI could hear Rachel's footsteps hurrying after me.\n\n'......It's going to be a chore to see these reactions every time.'\n\nIt was a bit disconcerting that everyone was so surprised by everything I did.\n\nIt wasn't a bad feeling, but if they kept reacting like this, it would be a bit tiring in the long run.\n\n'I guess I'll have to work on it.'\n\nSince I've been given this role and opportunity, I have to be sincere about it.\n\nI organized my complicated thoughts and walked towards the massive academy building in front of me.\n\n***\n\nKorn Ronezia, the headmistress of Reynolds Academy, was currently experiencing the worst headache she had had in recent times.\n\nThe causes of her pain included paperwork, academy management, and various incidents and accidents...\n\nBut the biggest cause was something else entirely.\n\nKorn sighed deeply as she looked at the boy standing in front of her.\n\nBlack hair and black eyes, a rare sight in this world.\n\nA tall stature and a neatly dressed academy uniform.\n\nHe wasn't a handsome boy, but he was good-looking enough.\n\n\"......\"\n\nThe boy's name was Raiden Lishite.\n\nThe greatest delinquent of this era, representing the Empire.\n\nHe had suddenly disappeared six months ago without a trace, and now he had reappeared out of the blue.\n\nKorn rubbed her forehead and let out a frustrated sigh.\n\n\"Sigh... So you've been absent from classes without permission for six months, and now you're saying you want to attend the academy again?\"\n\n\"As I recall, my absence was marked as sick leave. There shouldn't be a problem with me returning, right?\"\n\nWhat do you mean there's no problem, you little...\n\nKorn swallowed the words that were about to burst out at the boy's nonchalant response.\n\nHer long, red hair swayed as her emotions surged.\n\nKorn suppressed the mana leaking out unconsciously and groaned.\n\n'Damn it...'\n\nYes, she admitted it.\n\nIt was clearly her mistake.\n\nShe couldn't refuse Steiner's earnest request, who was her former comrade, to not expel Raiden.\n\nThe most ill-mannered boy in the Empire had even knelt down and begged her, so she couldn't ignore him.\n\n'If I had known this would happen, I should have just expelled him...!'\n\nKorn hadn't even considered the possibility of Raiden returning to the academy.\n\nHe slept through classes, always got the lowest scores on exams, and in the last academy ranking competition, he ranked 3080th out of 3086 students, a dismal result.\n\nHe was so unmotivated that she wondered if he really wanted to attend the academy at all.\n\nThat's why Korn thought, 'He finally ran away,' when Raiden disappeared.\n\n-Please, Korn. Do me this favor.\n\n...Well, it was Steiner's request.\n\nShe had planned to mark his attendance as sick leave and just send the diploma to the Lishite family.\n\nBut she never expected this delinquent to return.\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nKorn let out another heavy sigh.\n\nA troublemaker who flirted with female students, showed up drunk to class, and used his status as the Duke's eldest son to bully his classmates.\n\nThe news of this boy's return, who could be considered the epitome of an unmotivated student, made Korn feel dizzy.\n\nHe was even the one who picked a fight with Allen Reinhardt, the most promising student of this generation, so her worries were endless.\n\nKorn bowed her head, cursing her past self for giving in to Steiner's desperate plea.\n\nAnother sigh escaped her lips.\n\n\"Sigh... Alright, I'll make arrangements for you to attend classes again.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you. Then, I'll be...\"\n\n\"However.\"\n\nKorn's cold voice stopped Raiden, who was about to turn around.\n\nRaiden slowly looked at Korn with questioning eyes.\n\nHis expression seemed to ask, \"Why?\"\n\nKorn frowned at his brazen, almost shameless expression.\n\nShe raised her gaze, her eyes filled with a heavy pressure.\n\n\"However, if you cause any more trouble, I will expel you immediately.\"\n\nJust you wait.\n\nI'll expel you the moment you slip up.\n\nHer words were filled with that determination.\n\nRaiden looked dazed for a moment, then let out a bitter chuckle and quietly bowed his head.\n\nThen he left the headmistress's office.\n\n\"......?\"\n\nKorn was puzzled by Raiden's behavior.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nWhy was he so docile?\n\nShe had expected him to throw a tantrum or at least talk back to her...\n\nHe had just acted like a perfectly well-mannered student.\n\n\"......He must have some conscience after all.\"\n\nIt seemed he had heard from Steiner to some extent that she had done him a favor.\n\n\"I'll have to keep an eye on him for now.\"\n\nKorn muttered those words and turned her attention back to the documents.\n\n***\n\nThe next morning.\n\nI changed into my academy uniform and left the dormitory.\n\n\"Have a good day at the academy, Young Master!\"\n\nI waved back at Rachel, who was seeing me off, and quietly walked along the path. I could see other students here and there.\n\nI kept my head down, trying to avoid their attention.\n\nThe crossbody bag I had slung over my shoulder was filled with textbooks for today's lectures.\n\nI learned something surprising this morning.\n\nThis guy, Raiden, had memorized the schedules of all the dozens of lectures he attended each day of the week.\n\nPerhaps he couldn't completely erase his true nature even while acting like a delinquent, but he was strangely diligent in this aspect.\n\n'How did he memorize that complex schedule...? It made me dizzy just looking at it.'\n\nWell, was this really enough to be considered diligent?\n\nThinking about it, I also memorized my training schedule... right?\n\nI tried to recall my schedule from my previous life.\n\nMonday: Train until I'm beaten to a pulp.\n\nTuesday: Spar against six people simultaneously and get beaten up.\n\nWednesday: Survive against my father wielding a real sword and get beaten up.\n\nThursday: Get beaten up, beaten up, beaten up...\n\n\"......Damn it.\"\n\nThis wasn't memorization, it was ingrained into my very being.\n\nIf I couldn't remember this after getting beaten up so much, there must be something wrong with my brain.\n\nI frowned, feeling a wave of nausea.\n\nDamn it.\n\nI ruined my good mood early in the morning with unnecessary thoughts.\n\nIt was my first day back at the academy, and it wasn't off to a good start.\n\nI sighed, trying to suppress my gloomy mood.\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nBut even as I was lost in thought, my feet had steadily carried me to the main building of the academy.\n\nI snapped out of it and looked for my classroom.\n\nI had seen it once yesterday when I visited the headmistress's office, but it was still incredibly large.\n\nThe main building alone was the size of dozens of soccer fields combined,\n\nand with the faculty building, dormitories, and annexes like Building 1, Building 2, and Building 3, the entire academy was about the size of a small city.\n\nIt seemed a bit excessive for an educational institution...\n\nBut well, it had to be this grand to be called the best academy on the continent."

How dare a mere shield stand in the way of a sword.\n\nEven now, her body trembled as she recalled the words he had spoken to her.\n\nMargaret took a deep breath to calm her twitching eyebrows.\n\nHe wasn't like this when they first met.\n\nMargaret remembered it clearly.\n\nThe boy who had always treated her preciously, even though their engagement was a political arrangement made at a young age.\n\nThe boy who had silently approached her and patted her back when she was exhausted and crying from the stifling atmosphere of her family.\n\nHis shy smile.\n\n-I'll be by your side, Margaret.\n\nBut the boy had changed.\n\nHis face, now frozen in a cold mask, no longer smiled at her.\n\nFor some reason, he had become a delinquent.\n\nHe earned the scorn of many.\n\nWhen Lady Lishite, who had been suffering from illness due to worry for her son, finally passed away, his reputation plummeted even further.\n\nOf course, Lady Lishite's cause of death was not illness but assassination.\n\nAnd Raiden's delinquency began after her death.\n\nBut the outside world had no way of knowing this truth.\n\nThe same went for Margaret.\n\nThat tragedy had been thoroughly concealed as a top-secret matter of the Empire.\n\nIn such a situation, there was nothing Margaret could do.\n\nShe could only be hurt, tormented, and distressed by the boy's harsh words.\n\nEventually, due to a major incident, Margaret let go of Raiden.\n\nAnd she came to despise him.\n\n'......I will curse you forever.'\n\nMargaret clenched her fists as she muttered those words inwardly.\n\nIn fact, she had approached Raiden earlier with the intention of picking a fight with him.\n\nBut...\n\nAs she saw the boy's exhausted and depressed appearance before her,\n\nwords of concern involuntarily escaped her lips.\n\nAs he responded coldly, she came to her senses and tried to berate him belatedly, but\n\n-I said yes.\n\n-Lady...?\n\nHer words caught in her throat as she was confronted with the boy's unexpected demeanor.\n\nHis upturned lips.\n\nHis eyes, gently curved into crescents.\n\nIf she wasn't seeing things, it was definitely a smile.\n\nA smile that was strikingly similar to the one the Raiden of the past had often shown her.\n\nAt that trace of the past, Margaret's heart, which had grown cold, skipped a beat.\n\nIn the end, Margaret could only leave after giving him a warning not to do anything foolish.\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nMargaret sighed.\n\nShe wasn't someone whose emotions were easily swayed by a single smile.\n\nRaiden Lishite was still an object of hatred and resentment for her.\n\n...However.\n\nThat smile.\n\nIt reminded her of the past... of the kind Raiden she used to know.\n\nFor some reason, she felt a pang of longing.\n\nBut...\n\n'That's impossible.'\n\nMargaret shook her head.\n\nHe had already changed.\n\nHe was selfish, hurtful, and a womanizer.\n\nHe had become the type of person she hated the most.\n\nAnd in her experience, such people rarely changed.\n\n'Therefore...'\n\n...Therefore.\n\nIt was foolish of her to try to find traces of the boy she used to love in a single smile.\n\nMargaret turned her gaze back to the blackboard, letting out a meaningless groan.\n\nRight, he's nothing to me anymore.\n\nI don't love you anymore.\n\nMargaret muttered those words inwardly, clearing her mind of distracting thoughts.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nI had to endure the piercing gazes directed at me throughout the entire class.\n\nWhenever I turned my head slightly out of discomfort,\n\nI would see Margaret glaring at me with a fierce expression.\n\n'S-scary...!!'\n\nLady, I'm sorry.\n\nAre you angry that I answered rudely?

      "content": "Little Sister\n\n“Phew…”\n\nExhausted from the long lecture, I let out a sigh as I stepped out of the classroom. By the time all the classes were over, it was already evening.\n\n…This is so tiring.\n\nThe classes are too difficult.\n\nBack in my old life, I was practically forced to drop out of high school and focus only on training. I didn't even finish middle school.\n\nIt would be weirder if I was able to easily keep up with the theories and education of a different world.\n\nI’ve been trying my best to make use of Raiden’s memories and cram as much as I can…\n\nBut the bigger problem was something else entirely.\n\n‘What the hell, why are they all staring at me like that…’\n\nEvery class, the students stared at me like I was crazy.\n\nNo, it wasn’t just the students.\n\nThe professor teaching the class, the assistant on the side, even the janitor sitting in the corner.\n\nEveryone’s eyes were on me.\n\nTheir reactions were generally like this:\n\nAt first, they were surprised to see me reappear.\n\nBut soon after, they were shocked that I was quietly listening to the class.\n\n‘Well… I understand being surprised…’\n\nIf it were the original Raiden, he would have walked into class reeking of alcohol, challenged the professor, and hit on the girls around him.\n\nIt must be fascinating for them to see that guy just quietly listening to the class.\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nIt was a day that consumed a lot of my mental energy.\n\nOf course, compared to the daily life I lived in my previous life, this is heaven, but still.\n\nAs I was organizing my thoughts and heading to the dormitory, I spotted someone in the distance.\n\n“…”\n\nAt the sight of him, I stopped in my tracks.\n\nIt was a young boy.\n\nA gentle impression with kind eyes.\n\nShining golden hair and eyes.\n\nThe boy, whose appearance looked as if it were crafted by the hands of God, was walking through the Academy plaza.\n\n‘…Allen Reinhardt.’\n\nThe protagonist of this world.\n\nThe new hero, inheriting the legacy of the first hero, Ash.\n\nThe boy loved by the Goddess of Joy.\n\nI stared at him, recalling the many titles that described Allen.\n\nAs expected of the protagonist, many people were gathered around the boy.\n\nThe Empire’s second princess and the daughter of Duke Roben.\n\nThe chosen Saintess of this generation.\n\nAnd lastly, the student who held the top position in the first year.\n\n“…”\n\n…Somehow, they all seem to be women.\n\nIt’s not really an important issue, I guess.\n\nHe’s the type to get along with everyone, regardless of gender.\n\nUnlike me, he’s a being who receives a lot of love and happiness.\n\n‘What if I had possessed Allen instead of Raiden…’\n\nInstead of this body that is hated and wary of others.\n\nIf I had possessed a body that is loved by everyone.\n\nWouldn’t I have been able to move toward the happiness I dreamed of much faster?\n\n“…No, no.”\n\nIt was a useless desire.\n\nI’ve already received an unbelievable miracle, and I’m having these thoughts.\n\nJust how messed up of a person am I?\n\nEven the desire for happiness is too much for me.\n\nWhat right do I have?\n\nTo wish for anything more?\n\nIt seems I’ve become too accustomed to this small peace that the status window has gifted me.\n\n“Phew…”\n\nI clenched my fists, sharpening my mind that had become lax.\n\nCompulsion and anxiety gripped me once more.\n\nDon’t loosen up.\n\nAn opportunity has come to me too.\n\nDon’t ruin things with useless desires and jealousy.\n\nJust like my father taught me.\n\nWithout a single mistake, do it perfectly.\n\n“…”\n\nWhile I was momentarily lost in the swamp of my thoughts,\n\nThe saintess next to Allen nudged him and pointed in my direction.\n\nIt seems I was staring for too long.\n\nI quickly turned away and left the spot.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThat night.\n\n“Hmm… Young Masterrr…”\n\nWith Rachel’s sleep talking from the next room as background music, I was training my body.\n\nSimple push-ups.\n\nIn my previous life, I could easily do 100 and move on to the next exercise.\n\nBut with Raiden’s body, which had the miraculous stats of E rank in Strength and E+ rank in Stamina, it seemed my limit was 10 push-ups at a time.\n\nI had no choice but to create my own routine of 10 reps followed by a break and repeat.\n\nAt least, thanks to the consistent muscle stimulation over the past two weeks, I could feel my strength gradually increasing.\n\nI didn’t want to do exercises I did to death in my previous life in this life too…\n\nBut I needed to have at least a minimum level of strength to survive in this story.\n\nIn the original story, Reynolds Academy was embroiled in a ridiculous amount of incidents.\n\nCountless villains go on a rampage to eliminate the new hero of the era, ‘Allen Reinhardt.’\n\nSometimes, even high-ranking demons make a direct appearance.\n\nIn short, it was a complete mess.\n\nI had to prepare my body and mind to at least survive in this torrent.\n\n“Phew… Huff…”\n\nAfter several hours of exercising,\n\na mechanical sound suddenly rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Strength rank has increased by 1. Current rank: E+]\n\n[Stamina rank has increased by 1. Current rank: D-]\n\n“Finally…”\n\nAs expected, with low ranks, I could see results in a short amount of time.\n\nE+ was about the strength of someone slightly weaker than the average person.\n\nIf I repeated this routine for about two months, I should be able to reach an average D rank without much difficulty.\n\nOf course, from B rank onwards, ranking up becomes incredibly difficult, taking years.\n\n“Phew… I’ll stop here for today…”\n\nMy arms are sore.\n\nIt’s ridiculous how sore they are after doing just a few.\n\nI massaged my screaming arms and got up to take a shower.\n\nAt that moment.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Main Quest appeared!]\n\nThe notification rang in my ears once more, and the status window popped up.\n\nA main quest.\n\nThere shouldn’t be any events happening right now, right?\n\nI tilted my head and tapped the blue window in front of me.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Main Quest]\n\nTitle: Power Up\n\nDescription: Go to the designated location.\n\n[Map attached: Click for details]\n\nReward: ??????\n\nPenalty for failure: None\n\n[Time limit: 3 days]\n\n“What is this…”\n\nSuddenly, it’s telling me to go to a designated location without any context.\n\nMoreover, the reward is marked with question marks, and there’s no penalty for failure.\n\nIs there a reason for this?\n\nThe quests I’ve received so far have all been a kind of ‘guideline’ telling me how to act and where to go.\n\nIf this quest is telling me to go somewhere…\n\n“Huh?”\n\nI let out a sound of surprise as I checked the attached map.\n\nThe location marked on the map looked familiar.\n\nThe ‘Forest of Deep Time’, located near the Academy.\n\n“The Forest of Deep Time…”\n\nThis appeared in the original story as well.\n\nThe ‘Forest of Deep Time’ appeared to be an ordinary forest on the surface.\n\nBut if you follow a hidden path, it leads visitors to a hidden ruin.\n\nA ruin left behind by the ‘Gods of Three Emotions,’ who are known to have the second highest divinity among all the gods.\n\nIt was an opportunity that Allen stumbled upon while entering the forest for mental training.\n\nAllen obtained the sword known as the strongest in the world from there…\n\nIt was basically an episode that made the overpowered protagonist even more overpowered.\n\n‘But it’s telling me to go there…?’\n\nIsn’t this the protagonist’s opportunity?\n\nWhy am I getting this?\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nAfter a moment of contemplation on whether I should go or not,\n\nI decided to go.\n\nIt’s possible that it’s not the ruin and leads to somewhere else.\n\nEven if it is the ruin, according to my memory, there’s more to obtain from there than just ‘that sword.’\n\n“Should I go tomorrow?”\n\nThe time limit is 3 days, and if it’s really the ruin, it won’t take that long.\n\nIt should be fine to move right after classes tomorrow.\n\n“Well… I should take a shower for now.”"

      "content": "The second day after Raiden’s return to the Academy.\n\nDespite the short time, the news of his return had spread throughout the Academy.\n\n-The delinquent young master has returned!\n\nAs a member of one of the three esteemed Duke families that the continent kept an eye on, and as Raiden who was always at the center of unsavory rumors, the news spread quickly.\n\nNaturally, it wasn’t just the second years that Raiden belonged to but also the other years who were interested in the news.\n\nAmong them, the first years.\n\nThere was one person who looked dazed after hearing the news about Raiden.\n\n“My brother… is back…?”\n\nThe girl’s name was Ariel Lishite.\n\nThe eldest daughter of the Lishite family, she was a first-year prodigy with a natural talent for ice magic.\n\nAt the same time, she was the younger sister of Raiden Lishite, the protagonist of the news that was currently causing a stir in the Academy.\n\nAfter hearing the news from her friends, Ariel froze for a moment.\n\nThen, she abruptly stood up.\n\n“I have to see my brother…!”\n\nWith those words, Ariel rushed out of the classroom.\n\nShe could hear the confused voice of the professor and the commotion of her friends behind her, but she didn’t care.\n\nAriel only looked ahead and ran.\n\nHer feet moved from Building 1, used by first years, towards Building 2, used by second years.\n\nBut she soon ran into a problem.\n\n“Oh no…”\n\nReynolds Academy was as large as a small city, and even within the school, students had to travel by designated carriages.\n\nThe problem was that the carriages didn’t operate during class hours.\n\nSo Ariel had no choice but to run.\n\nThe distance would take 15 minutes by carriage, on foot.\n\n“Swift.”\n\nShe cast a spell on her entire body and started running.\n\nAfterimages of her red hair scattered behind her as the scenery quickly disappeared.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRaiden Lishite.\n\nTo Ariel, Raiden was a kind older brother.\n\nDuring her curious childhood, whenever she didn’t understand something, her smart brother would patiently explain it to her.\n\nEvery time she pestered him to play, he never got annoyed and played with her.\n\nWhen she was scolded by their parents and cried in her room, he would comfort her with kind words.\n\nIf he got snacks like cookies or chocolates, he would always split them in half and give the bigger portion to Ariel.\n\nAnd when she finished eating hers, he would make excuses like having a stomachache or not feeling hungry and feed her his portion as well.\n\nAriel adored her kind brother.\n\nUntil he changed…\n\nAround the time Ariel turned fifteen, her mother, Philippa Lishite, died.\n\nShe was killed while trying to protect her brother from intruders who broke into their mansion.\n\nAriel cried her heart out, calling for her mother who couldn’t even have a grave.\n\nShe spent the night in misery and despair, crying.\n\nUnaware that her sorrow was tearing Raiden’s heart apart.\n\nBy the time she had somewhat calmed down\n\nand recovered enough to look around,\n\nit was already too late.\n\nRaiden had already broken.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ariel never saw Raiden’s smile again.\n\nTwo years passed.\n\nA long time, yet also a short one.\n\nRaiden’s misdeeds, which she had thought would soon subside, only worsened with each passing day.\n\nRumor had it that his wickedness extended to assault, blackmail, vandalism, and various other forms.\n\nThere was even a rumor that he had raped a commoner girl.\n\nAmidst such whispers, Ariel gradually grew weary.\n\nShe could no longer recall Raiden’s smile.\n\nIn the past, whenever she thought of her brother, a smiling boy naturally came to mind.\n\nNow, the only image that surfaced was of him drunk and causing a scene.\n\nEven when Ariel tried to initiate a conversation, Raiden would unilaterally reject her.\n\nShe resented her brother.\n\nShe resented him for acting as if he didn’t care, despite her waiting for him like this.\n\nIt wasn’t that she didn’t understand Raiden.\n\nBut.\n\nBut…\n\n-…I miss Mom too.\n\nShe was also suffering from the same kind of pain as her brother.\n\nEven so, Raiden’s behavior had crossed the line.\n\nAs if he was being chased by something,\n\nhe was running towards a cliff, fixated only on what lay ahead.\n\nAriel was also a human being with emotions.\n\nShe was hurt by Raiden’s harsh words.\n\nShe shed tears of deep sorrow when she thought of her deceased mother.\n\nExhaustion and resentment gradually accumulated, growing in size.\n\nAnd those piled-up emotions eventually exploded.\n\nIn the worst possible way that Ariel had never wished for.\n\nIt was an ordinary day.\n\nAriel had recently entered the Academy and was diligently adjusting to her new life.\n\nThen she heard the news.\n\nRaiden had been flirting with first-year girls and ended up getting beaten up.\n\nAriel felt anger rising within her.\n\nThree days ago.\n\nIt had only been three days since she asked him to behave.\n\nShe couldn’t bear it any longer.\n\nShe thought that if Raiden had even a shred of consideration, he wouldn’t have acted this way, especially today.\n\nBecause that day was Ariel’s seventeenth birthday.\n\n-Raiden!!!\n\nOverwhelmed by anger and disappointment, Ariel sought out her brother and confronted him.\n\nWhy was he acting like this?\n\nShe asked him to stop.\n\nWas it so enjoyable to cause harm to others and act recklessly?\n\nThe girl expressed her anger, but her brother responded halfheartedly as usual, ignoring her.\n\nAriel felt a surge of resentment.\n\nShe was disappointed that he was behaving like this even on her birthday.\n\nShe hated him for shamelessly disregarding her words.\n\nPerhaps that was why.\n\n-I wish…\n\nThe suppressed, muddled emotions.\n\nDisappointment, sadness, anger, resentment, hatred—all mixed together, transforming into vicious thorns.\n\nWords she would never normally utter.\n\nWords she would never even think of slipped out of her mouth.\n\n-I wish… that day, you had died instead of Mom…\n\nEven she thought it was a cruel thing to say.\n\nIf only she had stopped there.\n\nUnfortunately, her mouth didn’t stop.\n\nAs if determined to pour out all the resentment and sorrow she had endured, she spat out disgusting words.\n\n-You should have died!! Why did trash like you survive while Mom died… Just you! You should have just died!!!\n\nWith those words, the girl opened her eyes that she had tightly shut.\n\nAnd she saw.\n\nRaiden’s face, was drained of all color.\n\nThe moment Ariel met his gaze, she realized.\n\nAh.\n\nShe made a mistake.\n\nRaiden froze for a moment before turning away and disappearing.\n\nAnd from that day forward,\n\nRaiden vanished.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“Huff… Huff…”\n\nAriel ran, gasping for breath.\n\nShe had arrived at Building 2 and was sprinting down the hallway.\n\nHer neat uniform was disheveled, and her red hair, which she had been so proud of, inheriting it from her mother, was now messy with sweat.\n\nAriel forced back the tears welling up in her eyes.\n\nThe last image of Raiden she had seen.\n\nHis pale face.\n\nHis wildly trembling pupils kept flashing before her eyes.\n\n-I wish… that day, you had died instead of Mom…\n\nNo.\n\n-You should have died!! Why did trash like you survive while Mom died…\n\nI didn’t mean it.\n\n-Just you! You should have just died!!!\n\nI never once thought that.\n\nI didn’t want you to disappear.\n\nI didn’t want you to be sad.\n\nI’m sorry.\n\nI was too young and foolish to say such horrible things.\n\nIt’s okay even if you’re not the kind brother you used to be.\n\nIt’s okay even if you’re called a delinquent.\n\nSo please.\n\nDon’t just disappear like that.\n\n“Gasp… Pant…”\n\nThe classroom door came into view.\n\nAriel charged towards it and kicked the closed door with all her might.\n\n-BAM!!!\n\nThe door flew open with a loud bang.\n\nInside, the professor and students stared at her in surprise.\n\nAriel looked around, searching for Raiden.\n\nAnd then, she heard a voice.\n\n“Ariel…?”\n\nAh.\n\nThat voice.\n\nThe voice she had truly missed.\n\nThe voice she had been anxious about.\n\nThe voice she felt sorry for.\n\nThe voice she had been waiting for.\n\nThe voice she loved.\n\nIt was just a single word, but Ariel recognized it instantly.\n\nIt was undoubtedly her brother’s voice.\n\nShe turned her head and saw a boy with black hair.\n\nHe looked haggard, but it was definitely her brother.\n\nAs she met his black eyes, filled with bewilderment,\n\nAriel burst into tears and ran to him, embracing him tightly."

Therefore, unless you’re with party members who have good mobility, it’s recommended to avoid approaching it…”\n\nClass.\n\n“Haa…”\n\nI yawned, rubbing my dry eyes.\n\nThis is truly exhausting.\n\nIt seems like keeping up with the Academy’s classes won’t be easy.\n\nThey’re teaching about monster theories and strategies, but how am I supposed to know any of this?\n\nWell, I do know thanks to Raiden’s knowledge, but…\n\nI have to memorize all of this for the exams.\n\n‘Wouldn’t it be better to just learn through experience like in my previous life…’\n\n-Slap!\n\nI slapped myself for having such a crazy thought.\n\nThe burning pain chased away the drowsiness that was creeping in.\n\nDamn it.\n\nNo matter how unfamiliar and tiring this studying is,\n\nit’s nothing compared to the daily life of being beaten and suffering.\n\nTo think I wanted to go back to that…\n\nWhat a joke.\n\nNever. No matter what, I’m not going back to that.\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nI gently sighed, rubbing my stinging cheek.\n\nAs I was organizing those terrible thoughts and lifting my head to look at the blackboard again…\n\n“…?”\n\nI realized the professor’s gaze was fixed on me.\n\nNot just the professor, but the students around me were also glancing at me.\n\nIt seems the sound of me slapping myself was too loud.\n\nDid I miscalculate the force?\n\nI gave the professor, who was looking at me, a gesture that meant nothing was wrong and forced an awkward smile.\n\nThen, the eyes of everyone looking at me widened.\n\n‘Ah, right.’\n\nThis smile has a petrification effect.\n\nI belatedly realized my mistake and quickly erased the smile from my face.\n\nThe professor, who had been about to say something, closed his mouth and coughed.\n\n“Ahem. Please refrain from sudden actions during class, Mr. Lishite.”\n\n“Ah, yes. I apologize.”\n\n“......!!!”\n\n-Thud, clatter, roll…\n\nThe professor dropped the magic chalk he was holding.\n\nThen, he looked at me with a horrified expression.\n\nThe surrounding students also stopped moving and stared at me with their mouths agape.\n\n“Did Young Master Lishite just apologize…? That delinquent…?”\n\n“Did we hear that wrong? That’s impossible, right?”\n\n“But we heard it so clearly…”\n\n“Damn it, this must be a demonic illusion. Reveal yourself, demon!”\n\n“Am I in a dream? Since I’m conscious, this must be a lucid dream, right?”\n\n“Hey, that guy smiled earlier, remember?”\n\n“Leave him alone, we must be dreaming.”\n\nAh.\n\nPlease.\n\nLet’s just continue with the class.\n\nI’m sorry it’s difficult for me.\n\nI’ll listen attentively, so please just…\n\nI pleaded inwardly, but the aftershocks of my apology didn’t easily subside.\n\n“I pray to Almighty Tinamius, grant me the strength to overcome this demonic illusion…”\n\n“Hmm… Let’s see. Where do I get treatment for auditory hallucinations…?”\n\n“Yes! This is the lucid dream I’ve only heard about! Time to fulfill all my suppressed desires in this dream!!”\n\n“Gyaaaak!!!”\n\nHey, why are you taking your clothes off? You crazy bastard.\n\nAs the classroom descended into chaos, I sighed.\n\n‘…Should I just kill myself?’\n\nForget happiness and all that, jumping off a building again might not be a bad option.\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever be able to adapt to Academy life with this body.\n\nAs I was lamenting inwardly,\n\n-Crash!!!\n\nThe classroom door suddenly burst open with a loud bang.\n\nThe attention of the students, who had been in an uproar, naturally shifted towards the door.\n\nIncluding mine.\n\nThe door, which had been kicked open as if it would shatter, barely maintained its shape in a tattered state.\n\nWhat is it? A terrorist attack?\n\nAs I clenched my fists with that thought,\n\nI couldn’t help but widen my eyes at the sight of the person who rushed in through the open door.\n\n“That’s…”\n\nFlowing red hair.\n\nA slightly disheveled uniform, but clearly well-maintained.\n\nA cute, cat-like face.\n\nI knew who she was.\n\nSomeone who occupied a significant part of Raiden’s memories.\n\nAriel Lishite.\n\nRaiden’s younger sister.\n\nI muttered the girl’s name in a daze.\n\n“Ariel…?”\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nThen, Ariel’s head whipped around to face me.\n\nOur eyes met.\n\nMy black eyes and her red eyes intersected.\n\nSoon after, tears began to well up in the girl’s red eyes.\n\nAriel ran towards me.\n\nAnd then she threw herself into my arms.\n\n“Brother…!!”\n\n“Ugh…?!”\n\nI winced slightly at the pain of the impact.\n\nDamn it, Ariel hugged me right where my muscles were sore.\n\nI groaned and looked down at the girl who had buried her face in my chest.\n\nAriel was rubbing her face against my clothes, tears streaming down her face.\n\n“......\"\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nWhy did you suddenly barge in here and start crying?\n\nYou have to tell me what’s wrong.\n\nEven in that moment, my hand was patting the crying Ariel’s back.\n\nWas it a reflex left in Raiden’s body?\n\n“Sob… Hic… Brother…”\n\n“Hey, Ariel…?”\n\n“I’m sorry… I’m so sorry… I didn’t mean it. It’s just…”\n\nThis is crazy.\n\nShe seems to have completely lost it.\n\nI felt a headache coming on and raised my hand.\n\n“Professor.”\n\nAt my call, the professor, who had been standing there dumbfounded, came to his senses.\n\nHe slapped his own cheeks a few times and replied,\n\n“Yes, Mr. Lishite.”\n\n“Would it be alright if I stepped out for a moment? My sister suddenly came to see me.”\n\nThe professor glanced at Ariel, who was clinging to me, and nodded.\n\n“Go ahead.”\n\n“Yes, thank you.”\n\n-Thud, clatter, roll…\n\nAt my words of gratitude, the professor dropped the blackboard eraser he was holding.\n\nAh, damn it. Deja vu.\n\nI should have just kept my mouth shut.\n\nI don’t even know anymore.\n\nI shook my head and led Ariel, who was still sobbing, out of the classroom."

      "content": "At the park located behind Building 2 of Reynolds Academy, there was currently the most famous pair of siblings in the Academy.\n\nOne was Raiden Lishite, notorious as the delinquent young master within the Academy.\n\nThe other was Ariel Lishite, the second-ranked student among the first years and considered a promising talent of this generation.\n\nThe siblings, each famous in their own way, were sitting side by side on a park bench.\n\n“Sob… Ugh…”\n\n“There, there. Stop crying. Stop.”\n\nAriel was sobbing sorrowfully.\n\nRaiden was skillfully comforting her.\n\nHe wiped her tears with a handkerchief and patted her back.\n\n“…Sniff.”\n\n“There, there. Blow your nose. Go on! Blow!”\n\n“Sniff…!!”\n\n“Good girl.”\n\nRaiden smiled softly and stroked her hair.\n\nAriel flinched at his touch.\n\nBut she soon accepted it.\n\nSeeing Ariel purring like a cat as he stroked her made Raiden’s lips curl up even more.\n\nAfter a while, as Ariel’s sobs subsided, Raiden spoke.\n\n“Are you feeling a little calmer now?”\n\n“…Yes.”\n\n“That’s good.”\n\nSilence fell again.\n\nAriel fidgeted with her fingers nervously, then carefully opened her mouth.\n\n“…Brother.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\nWhat was it?\n\nShe clearly had a lot she wanted to say.\n\nBut once she met Raiden, her mind went blank.\n\nShe racked her brain, trying to piece together the words.\n\n“…I’m sorry.”\n\n“Suddenly apologizing… What for?”\n\n“What I said to you back then… I didn’t mean any of it, not even once…”\n\nTears welled up in Ariel’s eyes once more.\n\n“Sorry, I’m sorry… I didn’t mean it… Sorry-”\n\nRaiden’s index finger touched her lips, as if to tell her to stop talking.\n\nThe coldness of his finger chilled her lips.\n\nAriel felt her heart breaking at Raiden’s reaction.\n\n‘…I… I was too late.’\n\nThe words I said can’t be taken back.\n\nBrother… he doesn’t even want to hear my apology.\n\nIf only, that day,\n\nI had stopped him when he turned away.\n\nIf only I had begged him for forgiveness, crying and saying I was sorry.’\n\n‘…If only I had made the right choice that day.’\n\nIf only I had stopped him from leaving, even if it meant clinging to his pants.\n\nWould he have forgiven me?\n\nAt that thought, Ariel couldn’t hold back the tears that flowed.\n\nRaiden’s voice reached Ariel’s ears as she lowered her head, her eyes red and swollen.\n\n“Ariel.”\n\nA gentle voice.\n\nHis baritone voice rang out clearly, carried by the summer breeze.\n\n“I’m fine. So stop crying.”\n\nAriel’s eyes widened at his words.\n\nHe’s fine…? He’s telling me to stop crying…?\n\nAriel had expected words of condemnation and rejection.\n\nShe was a bad little sister who had cruelly poked at Raiden’s sore spot.\n\nShe thought she deserved to hear such words.\n\nBut to say he’s fine, what was he thinking?\n\nHesitantly, Ariel slowly raised her head to look at Raiden’s face.\n\n“…!”\n\nMeeting his black eyes, she couldn’t help but be even more surprised.\n\nA smile.\n\nHer brother was smiling.\n\nThe smile he had never shown since he changed.\n\nThe smile she had longed for so much.\n\nIt was directed at her.\n\nAriel froze, overwhelmed by the emotions that washed over her.\n\nRaiden, seeing her reaction, made an unreadable expression for a moment.\n\nThen, he reached out and gently wiped her cheeks.\n\nThe tears that had been burning her face cooled down slightly under his cold touch.\n\nFollowing that gentle gesture, Raiden spoke.\n\n“…Don’t blame yourself too much, Ariel. I’m truly fine.”\n\n“B-But…”\n\n“I should be the one apologizing. I’ve been acting selfishly all this time… I’m sorry, Ariel.”\n\nAriel felt her mind go blank.\n\nShe had thought he would surely blame her.\n\nShe had expected him to look at her with hatred, for saying unforgivable words.\n\nShe never imagined she would be the one receiving an apology.\n\nHis eyes, as he spoke words of comfort, shone with warmth.\n\nFaced with a situation entirely different from what she had anticipated, a thought suddenly crossed Ariel’s mind.\n\n‘…Could this be… a dream?’\n\nA pleasant dream, showing her what she desired.\n\nA cruel dream that would leave her in despair when she woke up.\n\nAriel felt fear.\n\nIf this situation was a dream, she didn’t think she could bear the despair of waking up.\n\n“Brother…”\n\nBut.\n\nAs if to mock her worries,\n\nthe sunlight pouring down from the sky,\n\nthe wind caressing her cheeks,\n\nthe scent of summer tickling her nose,\n\nthe feeling of his cold hand on her cheek,\n\nall made her realize that this moment was real.\n\nAriel couldn’t calm her heart, which was overflowing with emotion.\n\nTears began to stream down Ariel’s cheeks once more.\n\nBut the emotions contained in those tears were completely different from before.\n\nNot fear, sadness, longing, or self-loathing.\n\nBut pure joy.\n\nTears filled with only joy.\n\n“Oh dear… Please stop crying…”\n\n“Brother… Brother…!”\n\n“Yes, yes, I’m here.”\n\nAriel once again embraced Raiden.\n\nThe boy didn’t push her away.\n\nHe simply raised his hand and gently patted her delicate back.\n\nFeeling his warm touch, Ariel quietly closed her eyes.\n\nAriel’s trembling subsided, and she fell into a deep sleep.\n\n“Ariel…?”\n\nConcerned, I looked down at her, only to find her breathing softly with her eyes closed.\n\nIt seemed that the tension had finally gotten to her, and she had drifted off.\n\nI held Ariel in my arms.\n\nAnd straightened her disheveled clothes.\n\n“…”\n\nHer soft breaths tickled my ears.\n\nThe warmth of her small body against mine.\n\nThe soft touch of her red hair as I ran my fingers through it.\n\nSo this is what it feels like to have a younger sibling.\n\nIt was a sensation like a warm summer breeze blowing through a cold, empty cave.\n\nI held this small life closer, gently stroking her cheek.\n\n“…Cute.”\n\nWhen Ariel first apologized to me with tears streaming down her face, I was quite flustered.\n\nBecause I wasn’t Raiden, but Kim Naru.\n\nHer apology wasn’t something I could casually accept.\n\nBut.\n\nDriven by the emotions welling up from deep within my heart, I couldn’t help but reach out to her.\n\nThe only emotions Raiden had for Ariel were love and guilt.\n\nThere wasn’t a shred of resentment within him.\n\nThe feelings of Raiden, who was now gone, seemed to whisper to me.\n\nTo embrace this lonely child in his stead.\n\nThat’s why I could forgive her.\n\n“Well, that’s all good and well… but what do I do now…?”\n\nIt had already been an hour since I left the classroom with Ariel.\n\nThe class would probably be over soon.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nI couldn’t just leave Ariel here.\n\nWell, if I take her back to the dormitory, her personal maid will take care of her.\n\nI carefully lifted the sleeping Ariel onto my back.\n\n“Ugh… Brother…”\n\nShe mumbled in her sleep, clinging tightly to my clothes as if she were having a dream.\n\nI smiled and slowly started walking.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“Ugh…!!”\n\nI stretched and stepped out of the dormitory.\n\nThe Reynolds Academy had separate dormitories for boys and girls, so I got a bit lost on the way,\n\nbut thankfully, I was able to safely deliver Ariel.\n\nThe current time was 4 PM.\n\nTwo hours had already passed since then.\n\nI had skipped out on the ‘Understanding Monsters’ class midway through,\n\nand I was already an hour late for the ‘History of the Continent’ class that was supposed to start at 3 PM.\n\nIf I went back to the classroom now, it would be 4:30 PM.\n\nThe class ended at 5 PM, so there was no point in going now.\n\nIt was more beneficial to just skip it.\n\n“Hmm… Then…”\n\nI stretched my still-stiff body and called up the status window.\n\n“Status window, show me the main quest.”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Main Quest]\n\nTitle: Power Up\n\nDescription: Go to the designated location.\n\n[Map attached: Click for details]\n\nReward: ??????\n\nPenalty for failure: None\n\n[Time limit: 3 days]\n\n[Time remaining: 56 hours 34 minutes 12 seconds]\n\nI was originally going to go after class, but since I skipped it, I should take care of this quickly.\n\nI looked at the map displayed on the status window and started walking towards the Academy gates."

      "content": "Sorrow and Contradiction\n\n\"It should be somewhere around here…\"\n\nI muttered as I looked around.\n\nThe sky, hidden behind the large trees, was gradually turning crimson.\n\nI was wandering along the path under the faintly shimmering sunset.\n\nIt had already been three hours since I entered the Forest of Deep Time.\n\nAt first, I thought I would arrive quickly if I just walked in the direction the map indicated.\n\nBut it wasn't as easy as I thought.\n\nDense bushes and fog of unknown origin covered the entire forest, making it impossible to secure a wide view.\n\nIn addition, the inherent power emanating from the sanctuary suppressed the use of mana itself, so I couldn't even rely on the power of magic tools or scrolls.\n\nI had no choice.\n\nI was still doing manual labor to find the entrance to the ruins.\n\n'I remember there was a passage under a certain tree...'\n\nThe problem was that I didn't know what kind of tree it was.\n\nThere were trees everywhere; how was I supposed to know which one it was?\n\nThe map provided by the system only displayed major geographical features, making it practically useless.\n\nIt only vaguely indicated the general area.\n\nAs a result, I had to spend a considerable amount of time checking every tree in the vicinity.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity,\n\nas the sky began to darken, I finally found a tree with a small symbol near its roots.\n\n\"…Found it at last.\"\n\nA sigh filled with mixed emotions escaped my lips.\n\nI'm exhausted. I just want to lie down in bed…\n\n'In the novel, Allen twisted a branch, and a hole appeared under the tree, revealing the passage.'\n\nI should be able to do the same, right?\n\nI circled the tree, twisting every branch I could find.\n\nAs I twisted the twenty-seventh branch,\n\n-Rumble…\n\nA faint tremor ran through my fingertips, accompanied by a subtle vibration.\n\nOkay. Found it.\n\nI turned my head to look at the ground on the opposite side and saw a hole large enough for a person to pass through.\n\nI carefully stepped inside.\n\n-Thud…\n\nThe smell of earth filled the air inside the hole.\n\nI lit a match I had prepared beforehand, illuminating the cave.\n\nWhether it was because no one had set foot here for a long time,\n\nor because no one had ever set foot here before,\n\nthe passage leading to the ruins was overgrown with tree roots and small plants and animals.\n\n\"Phew… Shall we go then?\"\n\nI had wasted a lot of time, so I needed to move quickly.\n\nThe dormitory had a curfew at 10 PM.\n\nIt wouldn’t be good to be late.\n\nI started jogging through the dark underground passage.\n\nSince I knew there were no traps or gimmicks, there was no need to be wary of my surroundings.\n\nSoon, I reached a point where the single path split into three.\n\nI stopped in my tracks, standing before the crossroads.\n\nAt the same time, a familiar mechanical sound rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Sub Quest]\n\nTitle: Your Choice\n\nDescription: Choose the path you desire.\n\nThe three paths before you each lead to a room where a relic of the Goddess of Joy, the Goddess of Sorrow, and the Goddess of Fury is kept.\n\nChoose one of the three and obtain the relic of the corresponding god.\n\n[※Caution※]\n\nOnce you choose a path, you cannot enter the other two.\n\nAfter obtaining the relic, a teleport leading back outside will automatically activate.\n\n\"Hmm…\"\n\nSo it was a relic-related quest after all.\n\nI stroked my chin, examining each path in turn.\n\nIn the original story, Allen chose the right path, the third one.\n\nAnd there, he obtained the relic of the Goddess of Joy, the holy sword 'Dawn.'\n\n'First, let’s rule out the right path.’\n\nI could steal all of Allen’s other opportunities, but not the holy sword.\n\nLater, Allen would use the power of that sword to defeat the final boss, a demon who was trying to resurrect the Demon King.\n\nIf I took the sword, there would be no way to stop the demons that would swarm in a few years.\n\nFor the sake of my future in this life, I’ll avoid that one.\n\nWith that thought, I looked at the remaining two paths.\n\nSince Allen never revisited the ruins after obtaining the relic in the original story,\n\nit was unknown what relics lay on these two paths.\n\nThe Goddess of Sorrow and the Goddess of Fury.\n\n“…”\n\nPersonally, I think the Goddess of Fury would be better.\n\nThe relic of the Goddess of Sorrow… just holding it sounds depressing.\n\nI doubt anything good would come out of it.\n\n“Yeah, the Goddess of Fury would be better. But the problem is…”\n\nJust because I prefer the Goddess of Fury doesn’t mean I can just go there.\n\nHow do I know if the Goddess of Fury is on the left or in the middle?\n\nEven Allen in the original story wouldn’t have known.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nI rolled my eyes, examining the crossroads closely.\n\nHoping to find some kind of clue.\n\nAfter a few minutes,\n\n“Hmm…?”\n\nI noticed something on the ground at the crossroads.\n\n“Symbols…?”\n\nFaint symbols were visible beneath the thick layer of dust that covered the floor.\n\nThe left path had a symbol of a red sword.\n\nThe middle path had a symbol of a blue water droplet.\n\nAnd the right path had a symbol of a yellow sun.\n\n‘Could these be the symbols representing the three goddesses…?’\n\nThe yellow sun on the right obviously symbolized the Goddess of Joy.\n\nThen, logically, the red sword on the left would represent the Goddess of Fury,\n\nand the blue water droplet in the middle would represent the Goddess of Sorrow.\n\nWith this simple deduction, I called up the status window.\n\n“Status window, main quest selection. I’ll take the left path.”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[First path selected.]\n\n[Confirmation complete!]\n\n[Teleporting to your chosen location in 5 seconds.]\n\n“Phew… Did it work?”\n\nNow, let’s go see the relic of the Goddess of Fury…\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The first path cannot be selected.]\n\n[Intervention is not permitted for relics that already have an owner.]\n\n“What…?”\n\nIt can’t be selected?\n\nWhat’s more, a relic that already has an owner?\n\nWhat does that even…\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The next path will be automatically selected.]\n\n[Second path. Teleporting to the location where the relic of the Goddess of Sorrow, Lotia, rests.]\n\n“What?! Hey, wait…!”\n\n-Crackle\n\nBefore I could finish my bewildered protest, a small sound rang out, and my vision went black.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-Thud!\n\nWith a loud thud, my body slammed onto the ground.\n\nAt the same time, my vision returned, and the darkness before my eyes brightened.\n\nI frowned, feeling a sharp pain in my stomach.\n\nI was standing upright before the teleport, so why did I end up sprawled on the floor…?\n\nI dusted myself off and stood up.\n\nThen, I looked around.\n\nThe atmosphere of the space was gloomy.\n\nThe air was chilly, unbelievably so for summer.\n\nWhite frost covered the interior of the vast, cave-like space.\n\nIn the center, there was an altar shaped like a staircase,\n\nand at the very top of the altar, a dark blue sword was embedded in stone.\n\n‘It’s pretty much the same as the description in the novel.’\n\nThe altar Allen saw was filled with brilliant light instead of frost or icicles,\n\nbut other than that, it seemed almost identical.\n\nI ascended the staircase-like path, approaching the altar.\n\n“That sword must be the relic of the Goddess of Sorrow…”\n\n…But seriously, this is so unfair.\n\nSomeone already owns the relic of the Goddess of Fury?\n\nThat wasn’t mentioned in the original story at all.\n\nAnd what’s with sending me to the second path without my consent?\n\nWhy even give me a choice in the first place?\n\nI suppressed the pointless frustration rising within me.\n\nWell, it’s already happened.\n\nThere’s nothing I can do to change it.\n\nI have to accept it.\n\n“…”\n\nI want to kill myself.\n\nReaching the top of the altar, I let out a deep sigh and reached for the sword.\n\nWell, I haven’t checked the relic’s abilities yet.\n\nEven though I’m feeling down, it’s too early to be disappointed."

      "content": "“Alright, let’s see what you’ve got…”\n\n-Screeeech!!!\n\nThe moment my fingertips touched the hilt, the dark blue blade let out a strange shriek.\n\nThe deafening sound made me instinctively frown.\n\n“…That startled me.”\n\nIt’s quite fierce.\n\nJust touching it once caused such a reaction.\n\nI knew that relics chose their owners, but did it dislike me that much?\n\n“…Well, there’s nothing you can do about it. Just bear with it for a bit. I’ll release you after using you for about three years.”\n\nI reached out again, this time firmly grasping the hilt.\n\nI expected it to resist, trying to wrest control from me,\n\nbut contrary to my expectations, the relic yielded easily, entrusting its body to me.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You have obtained the relic of the Goddess of Sorrow, ‘Lament.’]\n\nLament.\n\nThe name itself sounded quite ominous.\n\nI took a stance with the sword in hand and lightly swung it through the air.\n\nIt was a double-edged sword, typical of a medieval setting.\n\nAs someone accustomed to kendo, the grip and reach felt slightly awkward.\n\nAs if reading my thoughts, the status window displayed another notification.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Lament will transform into a form familiar to the user.]\n\nAs soon as the message appeared, the sword began to wriggle and change its shape.\n\nThe double-edged blade tilted to one side,\n\nand the long crossguard shortened to a more manageable length.\n\nThe pommel, hilt, and even the scabbard transformed to match the new form, and the wriggling finally stopped.\n\nThe double-edged Lament had become a single-edged sword.\n\n“Oh…”\n\nI examined it with curiosity.\n\nThe cold sensation in my hand, the perfect fit of the grip,\n\nthe appropriately sized crossguard and pommel,\n\nand the sharp, gleaming blade.\n\nWas it because this was the first sword I had held since possessing this body?\n\nIt felt like returning home.\n\nTo a home I never wanted to return to.\n\n…Well, it can’t be helped.\n\nI have to do what I have to do, even if I don’t like it.\n\n“By the way,”\n\nIs there no way to turn off the glowing effect of the blade?\n\nIt’s too bright; it hurts my eyes.\n\nI frowned and sheathed the sword.\n\nAs I did so, the blue aurora that had been swirling around me vanished instantly.\n\nNot only that, but the oppressive aura emanating from the sword also disappeared without a trace.\n\n“So it becomes quiet when sheathed.”\n\nThat’s a pretty useful feature.\n\nThe weapons left behind by the Three Goddesses of Emotion were considered top-tier relics.\n\nIt would be better to keep the fact that I possess this sword a secret.\n\nThat way, I could avoid the dangers posed by relic hunters and demons.\n\n“Status window.”\n\nNow that that’s settled,\n\nit’s time to check its actual stats.\n\n“Show me information about Lament.”\n\nJust by looking at it, it seemed like a good weapon, comparable to Allen’s ‘Dawn.’\n\nThere weren’t many weapons in the original story that emitted such dazzling effects.\n\nSo what about its actual stats?\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Lament]\n\nCategory: Sword\n\nRank: Contradiction\n\nSpecial Attribute: Lotia’s Blessing\n\nSpecial Skill: -View Details-\n\n“As expected, it’s Contradiction rank.”\n\nContradiction.\n\nAs the name suggests, it signified a paradox.\n\nThe original weapon ranks consisted of six tiers: Common, Rare, Heroic, Legendary, Mythic, and Divine.\n\nHowever, there were occasional weapons that transcended these ranks.\n\nThey were given the name ‘Contradiction,’ a rank that shouldn’t exist.\n\nPrime examples included the swords bestowed by the Three Goddesses of Emotion,\n\nand the divine sword ‘Bloom,’ which had disappeared along with the first hero, Ash Reynolds, a thousand years ago.\n\n“Well… being an irregular weapon, the conditions for using it are quite demanding.”\n\nI probably wouldn’t be able to utilize even 3% of Lament’s power in my current state.\n\nBut that’s okay.\n\nThe true value of a Contradiction-rank weapon lay in its powerful special skill.\n\n“Please… let it be a useful skill…”\n\nSpecial Skill.\n\nWeapons of Mythic rank or higher possessed a unique skill called a ‘Special Skill.’\n\nAllen’s ‘Dawn’ had a skill called ‘Daybreak.’\n\nIt was a skill that summoned massive pillars of light from the sky,\n\nannihilating all demons that came into contact with the light without any restrictions.\n\nOf course, being such an overpowered ability, it had the critical drawback of a one-year cooldown.\n\nBut the point was that special skills always boasted incredible power.\n\nWith a mixture of anticipation and anxiety, I clicked the ‘View Details’ button next to Special Skill.\n\n-Ding!\n\nThe status window appeared.\n\nAnd…\n\n“…”\n\nAfter checking the special skill, I couldn’t help but freeze.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“Young Master! Wake up! You have to go to class!”\n\n“Rachel… Five more minutes…”\n\n“No! You’ll be late if you don’t get up now!”\n\nI woke up to Rachel’s powerful shout.\n\nI quickly gobbled down the breakfast on the table and started getting dressed in my uniform.\n\nShirt, vest, jacket, all in order.\n\nNow, to tie the neck tie…\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nThis wasn’t easy.\n\nI’d need to have tied a necktie in my previous life to know how to do it now.\n\nAll I did was train back then; I never once wore a suit.\n\nAs I struggled with the necktie for a while,\n\nRachel, who had been watching from the side, giggled and approached me.\n\n“That’s not how you tie it. Give it here. I’ll do it for you.”\n\nShe took the necktie from my hand and began to tie it with deft fingers.\n\n“You’re really good at this.”\n\n“Hehe, I’m your personal maid. This much is basic.”\n\nHer neatly tied twin tails swayed as she covered her mouth and laughed.\n\nShe finished tying the knot and patted my shoulder.\n\n“There, all done!”\n\n“Ooh…”\n\nThe necktie was perfectly tied.\n\nIt was a world of difference from the clumsy knot I had been trying to make.\n\nSeeing my impressed reaction, Rachel puffed out her chest with a proud expression.\n\n“I’m quite skilled, you know.”\n\n“It seems so.”\n\n“Do you want me to teach you? How to tie a necktie properly.”\n\nI thought for a moment and shook my head.\n\n“No, it’s okay.”\n\n“Eh? Why not?”\n\n“Just… you do it every day.”\n\nTying this thing is a hassle.\n\nIt’s easier to just let someone else do it.\n\nRachel flinched at my words.\n\n“Y-You want me to tie it…?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“E-Every day…?”\n\n“Yes, every day.”\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nHer face flushed bright red, and she lowered her head.\n\nWow, she’s like a tomato.\n\nShe fidgeted with her fingers, muttering as if she were uncomfortable.\n\n“I-If you’re okay with it, Young Master…”\n\n“I’m perfectly fine with it.”\n\nIt means I don’t have to tie this damn necktie myself.\n\nRachel covered her blushing face with both hands and mumbled.\n\n“I-I’ll do my best… to tie your necktie.”\n\n“Okay, I’m counting on you.”\n\nWith a short reply, I got up from my seat.\n\nAs I stood by the entrance, adjusting my crossbody bag, Rachel trotted after me.\n\nShe was watching me with a satisfied look as I slung the bag over my shoulder.\n\nUncomfortable with her intense gaze, I tilted my head and asked,\n\n“What’s wrong?”\n\n“Nothing~ I’m just happy to see you like this, Young Master~”\n\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n\nWe exchanged small smiles as we looked at each other.\n\n“Well, I’m off.”\n\n“Yes! Have a great day, Young Master!!”\n\nI left the dormitory with Rachel’s cheers.\n\nThe blue sky and warm sunshine made for a fantastic day.\n\nAs I walked under the sun, I thought to myself.\n\nCome to think of it… wasn’t today’s class ‘Practical Combat’?\n\nI think it was held in the training grounds.\n\nI double-checked the textbooks I had brought and continued walking."

I won’t trip.”\n\nThe First Princess of the Empire, Lucy von Lietro.\n\nThat was the identity of the blonde girl.\n\n“You seem unusually emotional today. May I ask the reason?”\n\nAlice, the chief maid of the imperial family, tilted her head, puzzled by Lucy’s response.\n\nLucy was known for her childlike and innocent personality,\n\nbut she hadn’t shown this side of herself in recent years.\n\nAt Alice’s question, Lucy stiffened for a moment.\n\nThen, she frowned and replied,\n\n“That person… I heard he’s back at the Academy.”\n\n“By ‘that person,’ you mean…”\n\nAlice finally remembered.\n\nThe news about a certain boy who had been causing quite a stir lately.\n\nLucy’s old acquaintance, the delinquent who had become her nemesis.\n\n“You’re talking about Young Master Lishite.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nA fiery glint flashed in Lucy’s eyes.\n\n“After sullying the name of the Blue Bloods like that, he has the audacity to come back.”\n\nIt’s utterly disgusting.\n\nLucy muttered, clenching her fists.\n\nAlice sighed inwardly at the sight.\n\nShe was usually a kind and benevolent person,\n\nbut why did she always react this way whenever that boy was mentioned?\n\n“…As I’ve said before, he’s someone Your Highness no longer needs to concern yourself with.”\n\n“I’m going to teach him a lesson today.”\n\n“I understand you’re still hurt by what happened in the past, but…”\n\n“Just the thought of it makes me feel better.”\n\n“You’re not listening, are you?”\n\nDespite the maid’s concern, Lucy was lost in her own thoughts.\n\nAlice eventually gave up and played along with the girl’s words.\n\n“So, what do you mean by ‘teaching him a lesson’?”\n\n“During today’s ‘Practical Combat’ class… I’m going to challenge him to a duel.”\n\n“A duel, you say.”\n\nA duel.\n\nNot a light spar between students,\n\nbut a duel between nobles.\n\nNeedless to say, the implications of such an act were significant.\n\n“Do you have something you want from him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nLucy said with a twisted smile.\n\n“As a consequence of his defeat, I’m going to have him expelled from the Academy.”\n\n“As expected. I think that would be a fitting punishment.”\n\nLucy nodded several times at Alice’s affirmation and resumed walking.\n\nAs the summer breeze blew past her, the blonde girl recalled memories of the past.\n\nMemories of her once close friend,\n\nRaiden Lishite.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Her first memory of the boy was when Lucy was seven years old.\n\nIt was the day Duke Lishite visited the imperial palace.\n\nThe Duke, who usually visited alone, had brought two children with him that day.\n\nA boy with black hair\n\nand a girl with red hair.\n\nThe two children, standing before Lucy, bowed their heads in greeting.\n\n“Raiden Lishite, the eldest son of the Lishite family, greets the First Star of the Empire.”\n\nThe older-looking boy greeted first.\n\nHe bowed his head gracefully, displaying impeccable etiquette.\n\nLucy was slightly impressed.\n\nHis manners were perfect for someone her age.\n\nIn contrast to the boy, the girl behind him had awkward manners.\n\n“G-Greetings to the Little Sun of the Empire…!!”\n\nHer voice came out too loud, probably due to nervousness.\n\nShe stumbled over her words.\n\nAnd she mixed up the terms ‘Little Sun,’ which referred to the Crown Prince, and ‘Star,’ which referred to the other children of the imperial family.\n\nAs if realizing her mistakes, the girl’s face flushed red.\n\nWhen tears even started to well up in her red eyes, the boy comforted his sister.\n\nThe girl quickly hid behind her brother,\n\nclinging to his clothes and trembling.\n\nShe looked quite adorable.\n\nAs Lucy watched her quietly, the boy smiled awkwardly.\n\n“I apologize, Your Highness. My sister is quite shy…”\n\nHe apologized lightly and patted his sister’s head.\n\nA gentle smile graced his lips.\n\nLucy thought his smile was kind.\n\nA warm boy.\n\nThat was Lucy’s first impression of Raiden.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAfter that encounter,\n\nthe three children met regularly.\n\nAs children their age often do, they quickly became close.\n\nAriel Lishite was a cute child.\n\nDue to her timid nature, she would often burst into tears.\n\nEven Lucy’s playful teasing would make her whimper and cling to her brother.\n\nWhenever that happened, Raiden would calmly soothe her.\n\nRaiden Lishite was a strange child.\n\nHe was always kind, warm, and almost excessively altruistic.\n\nHis ever-present smile was like his trademark.\n\nRaiden’s personality had a profound impact on Lucy.\n\nShe learned a lot from him, who always accepted her childish emotions and tantrums with a smile.\n\nUnconsciously influenced by him, Lucy began to change her behavior.\n\nShe, who had lacked consideration, learned to think of others.\n\nShe, who had been arrogant, learned to humble herself.\n\nAnd those changes brought positive results for Lucy.\n\nThe maids who attended to her showered her with even more affection,\n\nand she was able to mend her strained relationship with her younger sister.\n\nRaiden was the person who had the greatest influence on her after her parents.\n\nLucy naturally came to rely on him,\n\nand as they grew closer, they became each other’s best friends.\n\nA few years passed, and they turned ten years old.\n\n“Raiden, Raiden, Raiden!!”\n\nThe Lishite family visited the imperial palace as usual.\n\nLucy ran towards Raiden, her voice filled with excitement.\n\nThen, she looked at him with sparkling eyes.\n\n“What is it, Your Highness?”\n\n“Raiden! You’re from the Lishite family, right?”\n\n“Yes, I am.”\n\n“And the Lishite family are the closest aides who protect the imperial family, right?”\n\nRaiden smiled slightly and replied,\n\n“You’re well-informed.”\n\n“Yes! Yes! That’s right!”\n\nLucy said, waving her arms excitedly like a child who had discovered something interesting.\n\n“Then, Raiden!”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness.”\n\n“Become my knight!”\n\n“Knight? What do you mean?”\n\nRaiden tilted his head, caught off guard by her unexpected request.\n\nLucy recalled the scene she had witnessed at the imperial palace the day before and spoke.\n\n“You know, the thing we saw at the palace yesterday!”\n\n“Hmm…”\n\n“The knighting ceremony!”\n\nRaiden clapped his hands lightly, as if he had finally remembered.\n\n“Ah, I remember now.”\n\n“Wasn’t it so cool?!”\n\n“It was certainly grand. It was the knighting ceremony of the Imperial Knights, after all.”\n\n“Right? You think so too, right?! Then!”\n\nLucy declared, placing her hands on her hips confidently.\n\n“You should become my knight too, Raiden!”\n\n“Me…? You want me to?”\n\n“I want my own knight! Knights are so cool! I read it in a book the other day…”\n\nIt seemed she had read a fairy tale about heroic knights.\n\nRaiden, seeing the girl’s innocent enthusiasm, chuckled and said,\n\n“If you think it’s so cool, wouldn’t it be better for Your Highness to become a knight yourself?”\n\n“That’s not possible!”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I’m a princess. Instead of becoming a knight myself, I should be the one who has loyal knights as my subjects!”\n\nRaiden nodded as if he understood.\n\nWell, he didn’t really understand,\n\nbut he knew from experience that it was better to just go along with Lucy’s whims.\n\nHe shrugged with a slightly awkward smile.\n\n“But why ask me? I have no talent for martial arts, so I’m not fit to be a knight…”\n\n“You don’t need that.”\n\nLucy shook her head.\n\n“Father said that knights and their masters are in a hierarchical relationship, but they’re also the closest of friends.”\n\nShe smiled brightly and said,\n\n“You just need to be there as my knight, as my best friend, Raiden.”\n\nRaiden looked at Lucy, who was smiling radiantly, for a moment.\n\nThen, he chuckled along with her and nodded.\n\n“Closest of friends… That sounds nice.”\n\n“Really?!”\n\n“Of course.”\n\nRaiden looked at Lucy and quietly knelt on one knee.\n\nThen, he said in a calm voice,\n\n“I, Raiden Lishite, pledge to be the loyal knight of the First Princess of the Empire, Lucy von Lietro.”\n\n“Mhm, mhm, mhm.”\n\nLucy tapped Raiden’s head and shoulder once each with the teaspoon she was holding.\n\n“May you always remain my friend, my knight.”\n\nLucy spoke with exaggerated emphasis, imitating the dignified tone of her father that she had witnessed the day before.\n\nRaiden chuckled and replied,\n\n“As you command, my liege.”\n\nIt was a small promise\n\nmade by two ten-year-old children who knew nothing of the world.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLucy stomped her feet and continued walking.\n\nHer mind was filled with thoughts of the wretched knight who had broken his promise.\n\nShe shuddered, remembering Raiden’s cold voice from their previous encounter.\n\n-A promise? Ah, you’re talking about that childish game.\n\n-I’ve long forgotten about it.\n\n-How foolish.\n\nA sarcastic tone and a mocking voice.\n\nThat was the voice of the changed Raiden.\n\nLucy gritted her teeth and glared straight ahead.\n\n“I’m going to teach that bastard a lesson today!”\n\n“Your Highness, please be mindful of your words…”\n\n“I don’t care! I’ll have him expelled no matter what!!”\n\nLucy shouted loudly, continuing on her way.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Its size was equivalent to several soccer fields combined.\n\nThis enormous training ground was one of the prides of Reynolds Academy.\n\nIt had state-of-the-art facilities and exterior walls that absorbed mana to cushion impacts.\n\nEquipment and potions of all kinds were readily available.\n\nThere was even a medical facility set up to immediately respond to any injuries.\n\nIt was an environment where everything needed for training was prepared.\n\nA class for the second-year Raphael class was in progress in this training ground.\n\nFor your information, the class name Raphael was taken from the names of saints appearing in the Bible,\n\nbut you don’t need to pay much attention to that.\n\nThe religious aspects of this world are so complicated that it’ll only give you a headache if you try to understand them.\n\nAnyway, the students of Raphael class were standing in neat rows, their postures impeccable.\n\nOf course, I was among them.\n\nOur gazes were fixed on a slender man standing outside the formation.\n\n“Good to see you all again today.”\n\nA green-haired man who appeared to be in his late twenties.\n\nThe professor in charge of the ‘Practical Combat’ course and the homeroom teacher of Raphael class.\n\nLucas Landlanto.\n\nThe large and small scars and lean muscles visible on his arms were a testament to the intensity of his life.\n\nDespite those intimidating marks, he had a gentle demeanor, which spoke volumes about his character.\n\n“As I announced last time, today’s class will be conducted through student sparring.”\n\nHe explained the upcoming class in a soft voice.\n\n“Pair up with whomever you want. Then, one team at a time will come forward and spar, and I’ll provide feedback and areas for improvement for each of you.”\n\nLucas gave us five minutes to choose our partners and watched us with a subtle smile.\n\nAt first, the students hesitated and didn’t move,\n\nbut as time passed, they started looking for their partners.\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nI just stood still.\n\nNo one would want to pair up with me anyway, so I figured I’d just wait and spar with whoever was left over.\n\nI squatted down in a corner, staring blankly at the students who were chatting amongst themselves.\n\nJust choosing a sparring partner, something so trivial, seemed to bring joy to these kids.\n\nTheir faces were full of smiles.\n\n“…”\n\n…It makes me envious.\n\nYou guys are living your 18 years like you should.\n\nMy eighteen years are filled with nothing but hellish memories.\n\nNot just eighteen, but seventeen, nineteen,\n\nand all the years before and after.\n\n-Rest? Why would you need such a thing?\n\n-Stop whining and get up, we’re not even halfway done yet.\n\nThe voices of nightmares echoed in my ears.\n\nI clenched my jaw and looked away.\n\nEven though the five-minute time limit was almost up, not a single person stood by my side.\n\n‘Well… it’s only natural.’\n\nI gave a bitter smile and brushed my bangs aside.\n\nI just want time to pass quickly.\n\nStanding here alone is so awkward.\n\nAs I was feeling self-conscious and staring at the patterns on the training ground floor,\n\nI suddenly heard someone calling my name.\n\n“Young Master Lishite.”\n\n“…?”\n\nSurprised by the unexpected call, I looked up to see an unexpected figure approaching me.\n\nLong, flowing golden hair.\n\nBlue eyes that seemed to capture the tranquility of the azure sky.\n\nA beauty comparable to Margaret, but with a completely different aura.\n\nI stared blankly at the girl.\n\nBecause, strangely enough, I knew her.\n\nNot just Raiden, but Kim Naru knew her too.\n\n“The First Princess…?”\n\nIt was Lucy von Lietro, the First Princess of the Empire.\n\nRaiden’s old friend, now turned nemesis.\n\nA minor character who briefly appeared in the original story,\n\nand the older sister of Allen’s love interest, the Second Princess.\n\n“…”\n\nThe girl I had only seen in the novel and Raiden’s memories was standing before me, looking down at me.\n\nAs I stared at her with a mixture of wonder and bitterness,\n\nLucy took off her glove and threw it at me, saying,\n\n“Young Master Lishite, I challenge you to a duel.”\n\n“…What?”\n\nI stammered, looking at the white piece of cloth that had landed on my shoulder.\n\nA duel.\n\nAs anyone who’s read a few medieval fantasy novels would know,\n\na duel held significant meaning in this era.\n\nSimply put, it was like a bet with a bit more force behind it.\n\nEach participant would wager something they desired and engage in a contest.\n\nThe format varied depending on the circumstances, but it was mostly a form of martial arts combat.\n\nThe loser of the duel had to fulfill one request of the winner, and there was no way to refuse.\n\nHowever, the winner couldn’t make unreasonable or unjust demands.\n\nOnly demands based on the principles of good and the eradication of evil were allowed.\n\nSurely Lucy knew all this.\n\nAfter all, Raiden had personally taught her about it.\n\nSo the fact that she was challenging me to a duel meant…\n\n“If you lose to me… you will withdraw from Reynolds Academy.”\n\nShe must see me as the ‘evil’ of this Academy.\n\nThis is insane.\n\nAt Lucy’s bombshell declaration, the students’ gazes subtly shifted towards us.\n\nLook at these bastards, not saying a word to my face but whispering behind my back.\n\nEven Professor Lucas was looking at us with a strange expression.\n\nMy head was spinning from this dizzying Academy event.\n\n“…”\n\nWhat should I do…?\n\nA duel with the princess? If I accidentally hit her too hard, I could be dragged to the execution grounds for treason!\n\nAnd if I refused the challenge, I would be branded as a coward.\n\nIt would severely damage my social standing.\n\nSo,\n\n“I refuse.”\n\n“Huh…?”\n\nWhat else could I do but refuse?\n\nI was already socially ostracized; what difference would it make to add more dirt on top?\n\nBesides, it was a duel with the princess!\n\nEven in a noble society, there wouldn’t be a single crazy bastard who would accept this challenge without hesitation.\n\nIt wasn’t just a spar; who would duel the princess?\n\nEven if I refused here, everyone would probably understand and let it slide.\n\n…Or maybe not.\n\n“Y-You coward…! Trying to avoid a duel?!”\n\n“I am deeply sorry. Unfortunately, I have been weak-hearted since I was young and am not suited for such grand affairs.”\n\n“…”\n\n“I trust Your Highness will understand.”\n\nI could see Lucy’s hand trembling at my brazen response.\n\nI had intentionally spoken in a slightly cheeky manner to provoke her,\n\nand it seemed to be working.\n\nMore importantly, did she really think I would accept the duel?\n\nI thought she was just trying to pick on me because she saw the old asshole in me,\n\nbut judging from her reaction, she seemed to be serious…?\n\nShe’s smart and good at studying, just like her father, but she can be naive at times.\n\nAh, this was Raiden’s assessment, not mine.\n\n“Then, I’ll go find another partner.”\n\nI couldn’t tell the Empire’s precious First Princess to get lost,\n\nso I decided to leave instead.\n\nHowever, Professor Lucas, who had been watching us, stopped me.\n\n“Mr. Lishite. I’m afraid you’ll have to spar with the princess, even if it’s not a duel.”\n\n“What…?”\n\n“Look around.”\n\nPuzzled by his cryptic words, I frowned and scanned my surroundings.\n\nThe time for finding partners was over, and all the other students had already paired up.\n\nThe only ones left were Lucy and me.\n\n“Oh…”\n\nDamn it.\n\nI swallowed my words and rubbed my forehead.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLucy and I were sitting side by side, waiting for our turn.\n\nWe were fifth in line.\n\nRight after the fourth spar, which was currently underway.\n\nEven while watching the spar, Lucy would occasionally glance at me.\n\nShe couldn’t stay still, fidgeting with her fingers. It seemed that my refusal to duel had shocked her quite a bit.\n\nWell, whatever.\n\nI was only focused on the impressive spectacle unfolding before my eyes.\n\nThis spar was between two mages, and I was fascinated by the clash of magic, something I had never seen in my previous life.\n\nOf course, I had acquired most of the knowledge about magic through synchronizing with Raiden,\n\nbut seeing it in person was a completely different experience.\n\nAs I watched the flames, water splashes, flashes of light, and shadows dance across the training ground, a thought naturally came to mind.\n\nThis is amazing…\n\n‘Maybe I should start practicing magic tomorrow.’\n\nAs I was pondering that thought,\n\n-Ding!\n\nThe bell signaling the end of the spar rang.\n\nThe match was decided.\n\n“Next students, get ready.”\n\nLucas’s voice followed.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

You’ve chosen an interesting weapon.”\n\nThis is what I’m used to.\n\nYour double-edged swords are the ones that are unfamiliar to me…\n\nAs I was gripping and releasing the sword, checking its feel,\n\nLucas approached me quietly and spoke.\n\n“Are you alright, Mr. Lishite?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“About sparring with the princess. You seemed reluctant.”\n\n“Ah, yes… Well…”\n\n“If you’re uncomfortable, just say so. I can switch partners for you.”\n\nLucas patted my shoulder lightly and returned to his position.\n\nI watched him for a moment, then came to my senses and took a step forward.\n\nI was momentarily tempted by his offer, but I shook it off.\n\nSince it was just a spar, not a duel, there was no need to go that far.\n\n…And I didn’t really want to ask him for help.\n\nI tightened my grip on the sword and stepped onto the training ground.\n\nLucy was already standing in the center of the large circular arena, ready to begin.\n\nI stood before her with an impassive expression.\n\nLucas lightly shook the bell in his hand and said,\n\n“Begin when the bell rings. Both of you, get ready.”\n\nI took a deep breath and widened my eyes, focusing.\n\nLucy also assumed a ready stance, aiming the tip of her spear at me.\n\n“…”\n\n“…”\n\nA brief silence hung in the air as we faced each other.\n\nAnd the silence was broken by\n\n-Ding!\n\nThe clear ringing of the bell.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPeople say\n\nthat modern kendo lacks practicality.\n\nKendo is a sport that focuses on speed and precise strikes.\n\nIt has its limitations when it comes to weapon grappling against other weapons in actual combat.\n\nBut does that mean medieval swordsmanship is overwhelmingly superior to modern kendo?\n\nThat’s not true either.\n\nCompared to the clean movements of kendo, medieval swordsmanship has many unnecessary techniques,\n\nand its rigid forms lack fluidity and naturalness.\n\nIn short, they’re both about the same.\n\nOne is suitable for combat but outdated,\n\nwhile the other is modern but not as suitable for combat.\n\nOf course,\n\nif a normally trained kendo practitioner were to face a medieval knight, the latter would have a higher chance of winning.\n\nModern kendo is relatively unfamiliar with real combat.\n\nBut that’s only true for ‘normally’ trained practitioners.\n\n-Whoosh!\n\nThe spear blade came hurtling towards me at a terrifying speed, tearing through the air.\n\nJust before it struck my face,\n\nI tilted my head slightly, deflecting it.\n\nThen, I lightly moved my sword, parrying the immediate follow-up attack.\n\n-Clang!!!\n\nA thin sound, too delicate for the clash of spear and sword.\n\nIt was the sound that could only be produced when my sword struck the tip of Lucy’s spear with perfect precision.\n\nI felt the weight and vibration through my hand and smirked slightly.\n\n‘It’s been a while.’\n\nWhen I was Kim Naru,\n\nI spent every day training, and around the age of seventeen, I hit a wall.\n\nMy technique had already reached its peak, with no room for further improvement.\n\nMy physical strength and flexibility were also far beyond that of ordinary people.\n\nIn short, I had reached my limit.\n\nNo matter how much I trained, my skills didn’t improve any further. Seeing this, my father introduced a new training method.\n\n-From today onwards, you will spar with these people.\n\n-Not one at a time, but all of them. Simultaneously.\n\nIt was sparring.\n\nNot just sparring with regular kendo practitioners,\n\nbut against various types of cold weapons: spears, double-edged swords, one-handed swords, rapiers, and more.\n\nMy father gathered masters of all kinds of weapons and lined them up before me.\n\nSince my technique had reached its peak, he decided to instill the very instincts and reflexes of combat into my body.\n\nAt first, it was two or three opponents at a time, but eventually, it became six or seven.\n\n“…”\n\n…Thinking back, my father was a complete madman.\n\nIt wasn’t training; it was torture, a form of relentless pressure.\n\nAt first, I couldn’t adapt to the raw, unrestrained fighting, and I just got beaten up throughout the sparring sessions.\n\nThe beatings continued.\n\nA year passed.\n\nTwo years passed.\n\nBy the third year,\n\nI had completely adapted to kendo as a form of combat.\n\nI could even hold my own against six opponents in the weekly one-on-six sparring sessions.\n\nBy the time I was 22 and participating in the World Championships, I had a win rate of over 90%.\n\nOne of the masters who had been beaten unconscious by me even called me a ‘monster’ in fear.\n\nHow ridiculous.\n\nIt was you guys who turned me into a monster.\n\nThat’s how I, instead of becoming a normal kendo practitioner,\n\nbecame a monster and once again rose to the top.\n\n-Clang!!!\n\nI parried another sharp thrust.\n\nDisbelief finally crept into Lucy’s blue eyes as she gritted her teeth and swung her spear.\n\nThe surrounding students also began to murmur amongst themselves.\n\n-He blocked it again…!!\n\n-Is that really Young Master Lishite…? I thought he had no talent for physical combat…\n\n-How can he so easily deflect the attacks of the princess, who’s among the top five in Raphael class…\n\nI tilted my head, deflecting the spear blade aimed at my head with the back of my sword.\n\nTop five…?\n\nSure, she had strength and some sharp techniques, but that was about it.\n\nHer gaze control was terrible, and her footwork was sloppy.\n\nEach individual move was decent, but she couldn’t connect them smoothly, making her attacks feel disjointed.\n\n“…”\n\nWell, I guess that’s to be expected from someone ranked fifth in her class.\n\nI had gone from watching the World Championships to high school level, so I hadn’t realized the difference.\n\n‘…The opponent I faced in the World Championship preliminaries was much better than this.’\n\nIn short,\n\nshe was a pushover.\n\n-Screech…! Clang!!!\n\nI lightly scraped my sword down the spear shaft and attacked her hand.\n\nAs expected, she let go of the spear with one hand,\n\nbut sorry, I had anticipated that as well.\n\n“Gasp…!!”\n\nThe moment the number of hands holding the spear went from two to one,\n\nI swung my right leg and powerfully kicked the spear shaft.\n\nThe impact sent Lucy’s hand holding the spear flying sideways, exposing her entire abdomen.\n\n“Ugh…!!”\n\nLucy tried to assume a defensive stance with a look of dismay,\n\nbut I had no intention of letting this opportunity slip.\n\nUsing the momentum and rotational force of my body, I spun around in an instant\n\nand delivered a clean roundhouse kick to her abdomen.\n\n“Ugh…!!”\n\nLucy let out a groan and stumbled backward.\n\nUh…\n\nDid I kick her too hard…?\n\nIt was hard to control my strength with this body, which had completely different strength, physique, and speed compared to my previous life.\n\nSince my Strength, Agility, and Stamina stats were so ridiculously low, I thought I could just kick with all my might.\n\nBut it seemed that my technique had amplified the destructive power.\n\n“Uh, um… Your Highness? A-Are you alright…?”\n\n“......!!”\n\nMy question was a mix of embarrassment and concern.\n\nI had asked out of genuine remorse, but Lucy seemed to have taken it differently.\n\n“Ugh, uh… Mocking me… You’re still as frivolous as ever.”\n\nNo, no.\n\nThat’s not it.\n\nI’m really sorry…?\n\nLucy’s deep blue eyes were burning with anger.\n\nI tried to explain,\n\nbut she ignored me, grabbing her spear again and shouting,\n\n“I’ll make you kneel today… no matter what…!!”\n\nSeriously.\n\nThis is driving me crazy.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Access 5 advance chapters with the 'Blink' Tier ($10) on Ko-fiShe Broke Down in Tears\n\nSword and spear.\n\nIf these two weapons were to fight, which one would win?\n\nMost people would bet on the spear.\n\nThe spear’s long reach gives it an absolute advantage in a ranged battle.\n\nIn reality, when a sword and spear clash, the spear wins nine times out of ten.\n\nThe weapon matchup.\n\nIt’s like an insurmountable wall.\n\nTo put it into perspective… no matter how big and ferocious a cat is, it can’t defeat a tiger.\n\nAnyway, for a sword to defeat a spear, there needs to be an overwhelming difference in skill.\n\nAnd fortunately,\n\nI had the skills to crush Lucy.\n\n-Clang!! Crack…! Thud!!!\n\nEvery time our blades clashed, loud sounds reverberated throughout the training ground.\n\nI controlled my breathing and widened my sweat-drenched eyes, focusing.\n\nIn my cold vision, only the sharp slashes cutting through the air were visible.\n\n-Whoosh!!!\n\nThe spear’s elaborate movements converged into a single point.\n\nIt transformed into a swift thrust, aimed at my right shoulder.\n\nI blocked it with a powerful upward swing of my sword.\n\n-Clang!!!\n\nThe loudest sound yet pierced my eardrums.\n\nFor a moment, I almost lost my grip,\n\nbut I immediately regained my stance and swung horizontally with all my might.\n\nI feinted a strike while stepping back quickly to create distance.\n\n“Huff… Huff…”\n\nRough breaths escaped my lips.\n\nDamn it, I’m already exhausted after moving this much?\n\nI had moved as if I still had my previous body, and my stamina was depleted in an instant.\n\nIt felt like my technique execution was a bit off too.\n\n‘But I don’t think I’ll lose.’\n\nStill, I felt a strange sense of unease.\n\nIn my previous life, I could have subdued an opponent like this within three moves.\n\nOf course, that was abnormal; I wasn’t weak now.\n\nI was still overwhelming Lucy, who had superior stamina and strength, with just my technique alone.\n\n-…\n\nThe noisy chatter from the surroundings had died down.\n\nEveryone was staring at Lucy and me, their eyes wide with shock.\n\nWhy are they so surprised…?\n\nI’m holding my own, but I wouldn’t say I’m doing anything spectacular.\n\nPoor stamina management, weak strength, clumsy footwork.\n\nThere wasn’t a single thing I was satisfied with in this spar.\n\nIf my father were watching this, he would probably beat the crap out of me in the name of teaching me a lesson.\n\n“Gasp… Huff… How… How are you…?”\n\nLucy muttered.\n\nHow am I what?\n\nYou’re practically telling me where you’re going to attack with your eyes.\n\nIf I couldn’t even block that, I’d have wasted the last ten years of my life.\n\nI adjusted my grip on the sword and glanced at the clock.\n\n‘It’s been a while.’\n\nOver ten minutes had already passed.\n\nConsidering my stamina, I needed to finish this in the next exchange.\n\nI might have sounded confident, but I was starting to struggle.\n\nI stepped forward once again, charging towards the blonde girl.\n\nLucy swung her spear as if to intercept my approach.\n\nI dodged it by twisting my body or deflected it with my sword, closing the distance between us.\n\n-Whoosh! Crack…!!\n\nEvery time I moved my head or body,\n\nthe sound of the spear blade narrowly missing me grazed my ears.\n\nI had abandoned all defense, focusing solely on offense.\n\nIf my footwork faltered even slightly, I would be vulnerable to a counterattack.\n\n“Ugh…!!”\n\nThe precarious situation sent my brain into overdrive,\n\nand the pounding of my heart made my senses numb.\n\nThe sensations from my previous life were slowly returning.\n\nThey were etched into my soul like indelible pencil marks.\n\n-Clang!! Crack! Thud!!!\n\nI could see it.\n\nMore and more clearly.\n\nEvery single movement the girl in front of me made.\n\nHer gaze, her breathing, her preparatory movements, her steps, her expression.\n\nEverything.\n\nI had already grasped her completely.\n\n‘She’s focusing all her energy on defense.’\n\nDid she notice that I was nearing my limit?\n\nIt seemed she was trying to stall for time.\n\nI could force my way through, but the difference in our basic stats was too great, and my stamina was running low.\n\nSo how could I create an opening in her defense?\n\nA moment of contemplation.\n\nThen, I smirked slightly and spoke.\n\n“My liege.”\n\nAs expected,\n\nthis kind of thing works wonders on kids.\n\n“Didn’t you swear to protect me?”\n\n“......!!”\n\nA heavy blow of trash talk, momentarily shaking her composure.\n\nA flicker of agitation crossed the girl’s face.\n\nAt the same time, her solid defense wavered, creating an opening, and I seized it.\n\n“No…!!”\n\nLucy came to her senses belatedly and swung her spear,\n\nbut it only grazed my forehead, failing to land a solid hit.\n\nI felt a burning pain where the spear tip had scraped past,\n\nbut I didn’t care.\n\nAfter all, this was all part of the plan.\n\n-Clang!!!\n\nMy sword, swung with all my might, knocked the spear away,\n\nand her hand, loosened in surprise, lost its grip on the weapon.\n\n“Ugh…?!”\n\nNot yet.\n\nAs soon as I confirmed that Lucy had been disarmed,\n\nI swept her legs out from under her, sending her crashing to the ground.\n\nThen, I thrust my sword into the floor, aiming it just past her face.\n\n-Thud!!!\n\nThe blade narrowly missed.\n\nI was panting heavily, half-straddling the fallen girl.\n\nBefore me, I saw the beautiful blonde frozen in shock.\n\n“Huff… Huff…”\n\n“…”\n\nDrip, drip.\n\nDrops of blood from my forehead fell onto Lucy’s cheek.\n\nIt was a wound from Lucy’s attack earlier.\n\nI had intentionally adjusted my angle so that the blood would drip onto her cheek.\n\n-Crazy…\n\n-…\n\n-…\n\nThe spectators were frozen in place as well.\n\nOverwhelmed by the excessively intense atmosphere, no doubt.\n\nThis was exactly what I had intended.\n\nShocked gazes, bewildered expressions, a chilling silence.\n\n‘Success.’\n\nI let out a long breath, satisfied that things had gone according to plan.\n\nLike it or not, I was going to attend this Academy for the next two years.\n\nBut I couldn’t afford to be treated like the delinquent Raiden of the past during my time here.\n\nMy mental fortitude wasn’t that strong.\n\nSo I needed a definite turnaround.\n\nA shocking reversal, something unforgettable, something that would be etched into everyone’s minds.\n\nThis spar was a performance to mark the beginning of that reversal.\n\nIt was also a warning to those who looked at me with disdain.\n\nI’m a crazy bastard.\n\nDon’t even think about messing with me.\n\n‘Of course, I didn’t plan for Lucy to be my sparring partner…’\n\nEven if it was just a spar, it would cause trouble if I beat up the Empire’s princess.\n\nSo I tried to subdue her without causing any serious injuries.\n\nIt took quite a bit of effort.\n\n“…Haha, hahaha!!”\n\nA refreshing laugh burst out of me, a mixture of satisfaction and exhilaration.\n\nIt had been a bit fun.\n\nThere was no father glaring at me,\n\nno masters relentlessly trying to beat me down.\n\nAnd my opponent wasn’t someone overwhelmingly strong, someone I couldn’t possibly defeat, like in the world finals.\n\n“Ahaha… Haha!!”\n\nIt was the first time in my life I had swung a sword so freely.\n\nPerhaps because the tension had finally broken, I was laughing like a madman.\n\nUnaware of how my actions would be perceived by those around me.\n\n“…Hic.”\n\nIt started from somewhere nearby.\n\nA strange sound reached my ears, and I lowered my head to look.\n\nThere,\n\n“Sniff… Sob…”\n\nWere teary blue eyes.\n\nHer trembling eyebrows and pale face told me that she was terrified.\n\nOnly then did I realize how strange I must have looked.\n\nI quickly got up, trying to calm Lucy down…\n\n“Sob… Waaahhhh!!!”\n\nBut the blonde girl burst into tears.\n\nAh.\n\nI’m screwed.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

You weren’t like this before, Raiden…!’\n\nIt wasn’t just his superior skills that were pressuring her.\n\nHis cold, black eyes.\n\nThose eyes, filled with unknown emotions, sent chills down her spine.\n\nEspecially,\n\n-My liege.\n\n-Didn’t you swear to protect me?\n\nThe bizarre smirk that twisted his lips.\n\nThat unnatural smile was enough to make her heart skip a beat.\n\nShocking words and a shocking expression.\n\nCompletely caught off guard by the boy’s psychological warfare, Lucy was defeated,\n\nand now she was whimpering, half-pinned beneath him.\n\nBut in truth, her tears weren’t just from the frustration of defeat.\n\n-…Haha, hahaha!!\n\nThe boy, who had been frozen in place, panting, suddenly started laughing like a madman.\n\nAs if he were genuinely enjoying this situation.\n\nHe let out a pure, clear laugh.\n\nThat smile, mixed with the vicious aura he had exuded just moments ago, created a grotesque scene.\n\nLucy felt instinctive fear.\n\nRight next to her was the boy’s sword, embedded in the ground, having narrowly missed her face.\n\nDrops of blood from his forehead were dripping onto her cheek.\n\nAnd the boy before her was acting in a way she couldn’t understand.\n\nTears welled up in her eyes.\n\n‘Don’t cry… Don’t cry…’\n\nLucy desperately tried to hold back her sobs, to maintain her dignity as a princess…\n\n“Haha, ahaha!! Aha…! Ha… Uh.”\n\nBut the moment her eyes met his black eyes, filled with madness,\n\n“Sob… Waaahhhh!!!”\n\nShe burst into tears.\n\n***\n\nThe spar ended like that.\n\nLucy, sobbing sorrowfully, left the training ground, supported by her attendants.\n\nEveryone glared at me as they passed by.\n\nHonestly, I had nothing to say, so I just kept my head down.\n\n“…”\n\nDamn it.\n\nWhy did I do that?\n\nHow could I make the princess cry, you idiot…?\n\nShe probably already hated me,\n\nand now I made her cry in front of everyone.\n\nAs I was reflecting on my mistake and repenting,\n\nsomeone called out to me in a gentle voice.\n\n“Mr. Lishite.”\n\nIt was Professor Lucas.\n\n…I’m going to get scolded, aren’t I?\n\nMy father used to hit me thirty times for every mistake I made.\n\nHow much am I going to get hit here?\n\n“…Yes.”\n\n“You’re bleeding from your forehead.”\n\n“Huh?”\n\nI had mentally prepared myself for the incoming slap,\n\nbut what came back was an unexpected question about my injury.\n\nStartled, I looked up and saw Professor Lucas looking at me with concern.\n\n“It doesn’t look too serious, but… you should be careful, or it might get worse.”\n\n“…”\n\n“You know the infirmary next to the training ground, right? Go get it treated.”\n\nLucas patted my shoulder lightly once again.\n\nSeeing his kind gesture, I belatedly realized something.\n\nAh.\n\nCome to think of it, it wouldn’t make sense for him to hit me.\n\nI’m the eldest son of a Duke family.\n\nThere’s no way a professor would dare lay a hand on someone like me.\n\nKorn, who’s best friends with Steiner, might ask, “What does your father do?” and hit me,\n\nbut not all professors are like him.\n\n‘This is awesome…?’\n\nNo getting beaten up after training?\n\nWhat a refreshing educational policy.\n\nSo I don’t have to apply ointment to my body before going to bed anymore?\n\n“Mr. Lishite?”\n\n“…Ah, y-yes. I understand.”\n\nLost in my silly thoughts, I belatedly came to my senses and nodded at Lucas’s call.\n\nI must be really tired.\n\nTo be having such pointless thoughts.\n\n“Then, I’ll be going.”\n\n“You can leave freely after getting treated. Class is almost over anyway.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI trudged out of the training ground.\n\nThe sky was clear and blue, and I let out a long breath.\n\nThe plan had been successful, and I had even enjoyed the spar,\n\nbut why did I feel so miserable?\n\n-Sob… Waaahhhh!!!\n\n“Damn it.”\n\nThose tear-filled blue eyes kept flashing before my eyes.\n\nThey overlapped with the remnants of the past I had seen in Raiden’s memories.\n\nI ran my hand through my hair in frustration.\n\n“Sigh…”\n\n…I should have held back a little.\n\nI’m always like this.\n\nI get carried away and lose control the moment I let loose.\n\nYou pathetic idiot.\n\nI’ve ruined so many people because of this personality.\n\n‘Should I apologize to her later?’\n\nShe probably won’t accept it.\n\nConsidering all the things Raiden had done to her.\n\nAnd now I even made her cry, so she might not even want to see me.\n\nWell… Raiden had made Lucy cry many times too,\n\nbut never like this.\n\nNever this much, and never in front of everyone.\n\n‘Should I kill myself?’\n\nA surprisingly rational option popped into my head, but I quickly dismissed it.\n\nAs I was writing a letter of apology in my mind with a bitter taste in my mouth,\n\na familiar mechanical sound rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Hidden Quest Achieved]\n\n“…?”\n\nWhat’s this now?\n\nA hidden quest?

      "content": "The first chapter of the regular release. Release Schedule: every alternate day.Golden Boy, Be My Sacrifice\n\nOne month.\n\nIt had already been a month since I entered Raiden’s body.\n\nMy tumultuous life at the Academy was already entering its second week.\n\nTime had flown by faster than I expected.\n\nMaybe it was because of the various events involving Ariel, Margaret, Lucy, and others.\n\nIt felt like the past month had vanished in the blink of an eye.\n\nStill, nothing major had happened besides that.\n\nThe only problem was that the Academy classes were difficult…\n\nWell, I’ll just have to muddle through somehow.\n\nI was slowly and steadily adapting to my new life.\n\n“I’m going,”\n\nI said lightly, standing at the entrance.\n\nThen, with a clatter, a head of brown hair popped out from the kitchen.\n\n“One moment, Young Master!”\n\nShe stopped what she was doing and scurried over to me.\n\nShe reached out and straightened my crooked tie.\n\n“You must dress neatly.”\n\n“…This is too much of a hassle.”\n\n“That’s why I’m here to do it for you~”\n\nRachel giggled and adjusted my clothes.\n\nHmm…\n\nThis was a bit embarrassing.\n\nIt felt like I couldn’t even dress myself properly, like a child.\n\nFeeling awkward, I asked,\n\n“Should I learn how to tie a tie properly?”\n\n“It’s alright~ I’ll do it for you.”\n\n“Aren’t you bothered?”\n\n“I actually enjoy it.”\n\nShe hummed happily as she spoke.\n\nWell, I can’t take away her joy if she likes it so much.\n\nShe already works hard every day.\n\nIt’s definitely not because I’m too lazy to do it myself.\n\nWhile I was busy justifying myself, the tie was already neatly tied.\n\nRachel smiled brightly and poked my cheek.\n\n“I hope you never learn how to tie a tie, Young Master~”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Just because~”\n\n“You’re being difficult.”\n\nRachel was great, but sometimes she said strange things.\n\nI mean, if I ask what you mean, at least explain it.\n\nIf you don’t want to tell me, then don’t say anything in the first place.\n\nI grumbled inwardly and opened the front door.\n\n“I’m really going now.”\n\n“Yes! Have a good day!!”\n\nWith her cheerful encouragement echoing behind me, I set off for school.\n\nA cool breeze ruffled my hair.\n\nHad time really passed so quickly?\n\nThe season, which had embraced the scorching heat just a month ago,\n\nwas now taking steps towards autumn, bringing with it a cool breeze and colorful foliage.\n\n“…It’s already been a month.”\n\nRaiden.\n\nWhen I first possessed this sinful guy, I thought it was a lost cause.\n\nBut contrary to my worries, I had been living quite peacefully.\n\nAfter all, there was still time before the events from the original story unfolded.\n\nThe only slightly disappointing thing was that my old image wasn’t improving.\n\n“Why isn’t it working?”\n\nI hadn’t caused any trouble in the past month.\n\nI hadn’t skipped class or been late.\n\nI hadn’t talked back to the professors, and I had been diligently attending lectures.\n\nYet, the persistent rumors and my reputation refused to improve.\n\nPeople were surprised when they saw me, but they didn’t approach me.\n\n‘Why? I haven’t done anything too noticeable…’\n\n…Or maybe I did?\n\nJust a little. Really, just a tiny bit.\n\nBut compared to Raiden, I was a saint.\n\nI made excuses in my mind as I crossed the street.\n\nSoon, I heard someone calling my name from afar.\n\n“Brother!”\n\nI looked up and saw a girl with crimson hair running towards me, waving both hands.\n\nShe was smiling brightly, carrying a yellow bag, and she looked adorable.\n\nLike a little chick.\n\nShe would get mad if she heard me say that, calling it childish.\n\n“Ariel.”\n\nI smiled faintly as I embraced Ariel, who leaped into my arms.\n\nShe greeted me with a cheerful voice.\n\n“Good morning!”\n\n“Yes, yes. Good morning.”\n\nI patted her head a few times, and Ariel purred, melting into my touch.\n\nShe acted more like a cat than a chick.\n\nSwitching between prey and predator… she was a scary girl indeed.\n\nI walked alongside Ariel.\n\nCome to think of it, going to school with Ariel like this had become a daily routine.\n\nEver since that day she stormed into the classroom, Ariel had been clinging to me.\n\nAs if she was trying to make up for two years of suppressed childish affection.\n\nI let out a sigh, feeling a bittersweet sensation at the warmth radiating from her arm.\n\n“…”\n\nAriel wasn’t annoying.\n\nIn fact, it was quite enjoyable to be with her.\n\nBut it was a bit overwhelming.\n\nLike experiencing motion sickness because I hadn’t fully adjusted yet.\n\nThe warmth of another person was unfamiliar,\n\nand it sometimes made me feel nauseous. I even heard echoes of the past.\n\n‘…I’ll have to overcome this someday. This is the life I have to live.’\n\nI repeated this resolution to myself, but my heart remained heavy.\n\nThe thought of becoming accustomed to peace and leisure was unimaginable.\n\nWorry and melancholy continued to weigh on me.\n\nIt felt like I was staring blankly at a possibility I couldn’t reach.\n\n‘It’ll be okay… Yes, it’ll be okay.’\n\nI forced an awkward smile, trying to conceal my complicated emotions.\n\nI didn’t want Ariel to worry if she saw my gloomy expression.\n\nAs I was sorting out my thoughts,\n\nwe arrived at the carriage stop.\n\n“Bye!

Hammer Slayer\n\n8.\n\nAfter a month of rigorous training, I had successfully raised all my Strength, Stamina, and Agility stats to D rank.\n\nAnd the titles.\n\nAfter defeating Lucy and obtaining the ‘Spear Slayer’ title,\n\nI had been seeking out students with C rank or higher weapon proficiency at the Academy, challenging them to fight.\n\nYou might think it’s strange for someone who wants to live peacefully to be picking fights…\n\nbut it was unavoidable for title farming.\n\nTo get the synergy title, I needed to obtain five ‘Slayer’ titles.\n\nAs a result, a bizarre rumor spread throughout the Academy that the crazed delinquent son of Duke Lishite was hunting down honor students.\n\nBut I’m sure everyone will understand.\n\nHonestly, it’s better to be known as a guy who’s always brawling than someone who disrupts classes and hits on girls.\n\nI was using a kind of cover-up strategy. It was all part of my plan.\n\n‘…It’s like comparing apples and oranges.’\n\nI tried to ignore the voice of my conscience and\n\nturned my attention back to the status window.\n\nSpear Slayer, Sword Slayer, Martial Arts Slayer, Hammer Slayer.\n\nI had four titles so far.\n\nI was just one title away from achieving the synergy title.\n\nAnd right now, I was on my way to obtain that last title.\n\n“Are you here to use the training ground?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Please write your name on this list, check the safety guidelines, and then you may enter.”\n\n“Understood.”\n\nI arrived at the training ground while fiddling with the status window.\n\nIgnoring the guide, who was trying to act calm but whose hands were trembling, I stepped inside.\n\nI quickly scanned the interior as soon as I passed through the door.\n\nCountless pieces of training equipment and students sweating as they honed their skills.\n\nAmong them, one boy stood out.\n\n“There he is.”\n\nUnnatural golden hair that looked dyed.\n\nDeeply tanned skin.\n\nSharp, cunning eyes with blue irises.\n\nHe had the unmistakable aura of a delinquent.\n\nThe boy, who was jogging lightly on the track with sandbags strapped to his ankles,\n\nturned and tried to flee as soon as our eyes met.\n\n“Oh, crap!! That psycho is here again!”\n\nNo way.\n\nI quickly kicked off the ground and chased after him.\n\nHe glanced back at me as he ran, shouting,\n\n“Stop it!! You crazy bastard!”\n\n“Let’s fight.”\n\n“No way, I already sparred with you yesterday!! Damn it, how many times is this!? This is the fourth time since last week!”\n\nI gradually increased my speed.\n\nThe distance between us slowly closed, and I was getting closer and closer to his tail.\n\n“Let’s fight.”\n\n“No, damn it!! I’d understand if you lost, but you won every time! Why do you keep coming back after beating me four times in a row?!”\n\nBecause I haven’t gotten the Slayer title yet.\n\nThe condition for obtaining the ‘Slayer’ title was to win against a martial artist of rank C or higher.\n\nAnd the number of times I got hit during the spar had to be less than three.\n\nEven a slight graze counted as a hit.\n\nIn other words, the sparring would continue until I achieved a perfect victory.\n\n“Let’s fight.”\n\n“Get lost!! I’m not sparring with you!!”\n\nHe screamed and dashed towards the back door of the training ground.\n\nBut there was no escape.\n\nWhen I was about ten steps away from him, I muttered,\n\n“Blink ×10.”\n\nWith a small chant, my vision flickered rapidly.\n\nThis was a technique that used multiple short-range Blinks in succession.\n\nIt allowed me to cover a distance of up to ten meters as if it were a single teleport.\n\nIt wasn’t easy to control, so I was still practicing it.\n\nFortunately, this attempt seemed successful.\n\n“Whoa?!”\n\nThe flustered face of the golden-haired, tanned delinquent appeared before me.\n\nHe tried to change direction abruptly, but my foot was faster, tripping him.\n\n“Whoaaaa!”\n\nHe tumbled to the ground with a loud thud.\n\nI looked down at the golden boy, groaning in pain, and said,\n\n“Let’s fight.”\n\nHe clutched his knee, which had hit the floor, and tears welled up in his eyes.\n\n“Y-You… You crazy bastard… Sob…”\n\n“Let’s fight.”\n\nFor the record, there’s no right to refuse.\n\nJust quietly become the sacrifice for my Slayer title farming.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Why are you doing this to me… What did I do wrong…?”\n\nI silently hung the wooden sword I had used on the rack.\n\nHe looked at me with uneasy eyes for a moment, then asked cautiously,\n\n“…Are you… coming back tomorrow?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Damn it, why aren’t you answering?”\n\n“I’m coming back.”\n\nBecause I didn’t get the title this time.\n\nIf I had dodged his last attack, I would have succeeded, but my footwork messed up.\n\nSorry about that.\n\nActually, I’m not really sorry.\n\n“This crazy…”\n\nAs if touched by my answer, the Golden Boy’s eyes welled up again.\n\n“W-Why are you doing this to me…”\n\n“Blame your strength.”\n\nIf you were just an average C rank, I would have gotten the title in one go and wouldn’t have come back.\n\nBut you’re almost B- rank.\n\nDo you know how hard it is to beat you with my Strength, Stamina, and Agility stats?\n\n“Damn it.”\n\nHe let out a small curse, oblivious to my struggles.\n\nOf course, I pretended not to hear him.\n\nIf someone who didn’t know the situation saw us now, they might scold me for bullying an innocent commoner student.\n\nBut they would be mistaken.\n\nThis guy wasn’t actually in pain.\n\nJust look at the corners of his lips curling up into a smirk.\n\n“…You have a really stupid look on your face.”\n\n“Pfft! What’s with the sudden insult about my looks? Why, are you jealous because I’m so handsome?”\n\n“…”\n\nAs you can see. He’s not normal either.\n\nI mean, cursing at the eldest son of a Duke is crazy in itself.\n\n‘Isn’t he worried that he might get killed…?’\n\nI tilted my head.\n\nWell, I don’t care about this kind of thing, so it’s fine for me,\n\nbut he shouldn’t act like this towards other nobles.\n\n-Zap\n\n“…?”\n\nLost in thought, I was brought back to reality by a sharp pain in my arm.\n\nI rolled up my sleeve and saw a blue bruise on my elbow.\n\nIt seemed to be the aftermath of the last attack, which I failed to dodge.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nYesterday, and the day before that too.\n\nHe was quite skilled, managing to land attacks on me every time.\n\nWell, it made sense.\n\nUnlike nobles who entered the Academy with money and family connections,\n\ncommoners mostly entered through exams.\n\nThis guy in front of me was ranked among the top students in the second year.\n\n‘Was he around 50th place?’\n\nRecalling last year’s rankings, which I had looked up recently, I rummaged through my crossbody bag.\n\nI took out a bottle of healing potion and started applying it to my bruised elbow.\n\nAs the strong antiseptic smell of the potion filled the air, the Golden Boy crawled over to me.\n\n“…What?”\n\n“Give me some potion too.”\n\n“Buy it with your own money.”\n\nWhen I spoke coldly, he protested with an indignant look,\n\n“No way, I can’t afford that expensive stuff…! Besides, you’re the one who beat me up!”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nCome to think of it, he was right.\n\nI obediently took out another bottle of potion and tossed it to him.\n\n“This is the last time.”\n\n“Hehe… Thank you, Sensei.”\n\nHe barely caught the bottle and grinned foolishly.\n\nWow… He really looked like a simpleton from the countryside.\n\nI’d never actually met someone like that, but if I did, I imagined they would look like him.\n\nAs I was marveling at his appearance, he poured the potion all over himself and asked,\n\n“By the way, are you really the Raiden who was last in the ranking matches last year?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Well~ It’s hard to believe~ I’m pretty confident in my skills, but you completely destroyed me.”\n\nHis ranking last year was 53rd out of 3086 students.\n\nIt wasn’t a skill to be scoffed at.\n\nIf he maintained this ranking, he would be scouted by prestigious noble families by the time he graduated.\n\n“And I heard you’ve been picking fights with other high-ranking students too?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Rumors are flying around that you won without getting hit once, that you slammed someone’s head into the ground… How did you do it?”\n\n…Damn it.\n\nThis was just karma for my actions, so I couldn’t say anything.\n\nEven if it was for title farming, I think I went a bit overboard.\n\n“You must be really damn strong.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nI answered vaguely with a troubled heart and got up from my spot.\n\nThe Golden Boy, who had been excitedly chattering, stopped talking and looked at me.\n\n“Oh, are you leaving?”\n\n“Yes, I’m done here. I’ll see you tomorrow.”\n\n“Don’t come back, damn it. Never come back.”\n\n“See you tomorrow then.”\n\n“Don’t come back!!”\n\nI ignored his voice and left the training ground.\n\nStrange noises continued to come from behind me, but I didn’t care.\n\nI checked the time and thought about my next schedule.\n\n‘Next training is mastering my unique talent, right?’\n\nBusy, busy.\n\nI headed towards the carriage stop.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Magic Department building was located a ten-minute carriage ride from the training ground.\n\nThis place, designed for students to practice magic freely, boasts high-quality equipment and robust facilities.\n\nThanks to this, the students could train their magic with peace of mind,\n\nand the Magic Department building was always filled with the sounds of mana exploding and shattering.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

You don’t look so good this morning.”\n\nThe red-haired girl looked up at me with worried eyes.\n\nI gently stroked her hair, and she purred, melting into my touch.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\n…Maybe I’m feeling a bit better?\n\nCuteness is amazing.\n\nIt can even alleviate trauma.\n\nI hid my irritation and gloom behind a facade of composure and smiled.\n\n“I’m fine. I just had a rough night’s sleep, so I’m a bit tired.”\n\n“Are you feeling sick?”\n\n“Don’t worry, it’s nothing like that.”\n\nI ruffled her hair lightly and smiled.\n\n“More importantly, let’s get started.”\n\nI tapped the training sword in my hand to distract Ariel.\n\nShe glanced at me for a moment, then reached for the staff strapped to her back.\n\nI smiled at her again and stood in the middle of the training ground.\n\n“Brother! Should I stand here?”\n\n“A little further back.”\n\n“Like this?”\n\n“Perfect.”\n\nAriel positioned herself a short distance away from me.\n\nShe channeled mana into her staff, preparing a spell.\n\n“But what kind of training are we doing? You usually train alone, brother.”\n\n“There’s something I want to practice.”\n\n“Practice?”\n\nAriel tilted her head at my answer.\n\nI fiddled with the other sword sheathed at my waist and replied,\n\n“Yeah. I recently… well, not recently, but about a month ago, I obtained a new ability, and I want to test it out.”\n\n“You obtained an ability?”\n\n“Hmm… Let’s just say I want to practice a new technique.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nAriel nodded in understanding.\n\nI tightened my grip on the sword in my hand.\n\nThen, with my other hand, I gently stroked Sorrow, which was sheathed at my waist.\n\n-Click…\n\nIt responded with a strange sound.\n\nThis sword was the key to today’s training.\n\nI needed to get a feel for it before I could properly use it in actual combat.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t swing it around freely, as I couldn’t let anyone know it was a divine artifact.\n\nBut I should be able to use its special skills without being noticed.\n\nThe scabbard perfectly suppressed Sorrow’s unique aura.\n\n“Let’s do this.”\n\nAs I gripped the hilt tightly, Sorrow resonated as if excited.\n\n-Woooong, wooong…\n\nI patted it reassuringly and looked ahead.\n\nThere, the red-haired witch stood, aiming her staff at me.\n\nAriel waved her hand and shouted,\n\n“Brother~! Shall we begin~?”\n\nI raised a finger, giving her the okay sign.\n\nShe slammed her mana-infused staff onto the ground.\n\n-Thud!\n\nThe impact resonated, and the surrounding mana began to stir.\n\n-Rumble…!!\n\nThe agitated mana particles collided with each other, creating a strange humming sound.\n\nI felt a tingling sensation throughout my body and adjusted my stance.\n\nAmidst the turbulent flow, Ariel focused all her energy on manipulating the magic, her eyes closed.\n\nHer small lips began to chant.\n\n“O, winter’s bitter cold.”\n\nBefore records were kept,\n\nMarybell, who bloomed frost flowers in a pristine world.\n\nHear my call, the rightful heir of the frozen wasteland.\n\nI covet your grand slaughter,\n\nand seek to build a tower of sorrow with the tears of fallen witches.\n\n“Grant me the chill that will erase summer.”\n\n-Application of the Seventh Verse of Ariel’s Frost Magic-\n\n‘Thin Ice Descends (薄氷如臨)’\n\nAs the chant ended, the surrounding temperature plummeted.\n\nWhite frost began to form around Ariel’s feet,\n\nand her breath condensed into visible puffs of air.\n\nMassive shards of ice emerged behind her.\n\n“Frostbite, Ice Spears.”\n\nA hundred ice spears filled the sky.\n\nI watched the spectacle with a smirk.\n\nAs expected of a member of the Lishite family.\n\nAriel possessed an overwhelming talent for frost magic, befitting someone born with such a gift.\n\nAriel Lishite, the ‘Winter Witch’ who would succeed Steiner Lishite, the ‘Flame Emperor.’\n\nI tightened my grip on Sorrow to shake off the sense of intimidation.\n\nThen, I muttered,\n\n“Sorrow.”\n\nAs soon as I uttered its name, the blade vibrated wildly.\n\nI maintained a firm stance and balance, suppressing its frenzy, and opened my eyes.\n\nA faint blue aura flickered across my eyelids.\n\nI spoke the activation word.\n\n“Awaken.”\n\n-Screeeech!!!!\n\nSorrow let out a ferocious shriek.\n\nA blue aura leaked from the scabbard, flowing along my hand that held the hilt.\n\nIt slithered up my wrist like a snake, then wrapped around my entire body.\n\nMy senses…\n\nAwakened.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The divine artifact ‘Sorrow’s’ unique skill 1, ‘Extrasensory,’ has been activated.]\n\n[※The maximum duration of Extrasensory is 10 minutes.※]\n\n[Remaining time: 9 minutes 59 seconds]\n\nA tingling sensation…\n\nA subtle pain coursed through my body as the status window appeared.\n\nThen, all my senses sharpened to an agonizing degree.\n\n“Ugh…!”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Due to the backlash from the special skill ‘Extrasensory,’ you are afflicted with the status effects (Confusion, Nausea, Headache)!]\n\nMy head felt like it was splitting open.\n\nSounds I had never heard before rang clearly in my ears,\n\nand minute details that were previously invisible were now displayed as clear as photographs.\n\nI could feel the flow of the wind, the temperature of the air, and other chaotic currents against my skin.\n\nHundreds of scents, usually unnoticed, mingled in my nostrils.\n\nIt was agonizing.\n\nMy eardrums felt like they were about to burst.\n\nMy pupils felt like they were burning.\n\nIt felt like my skin was being peeled off in real time,\n\nand a sharp, piercing pain assaulted my nose.\n\nAs if my brain couldn’t process the overwhelming amount of information, my consciousness began to fade.\n\n“Ugh…!!”\n\nI almost gagged but swallowed it down.\n\nIt’s okay. Just hold on a little longer, and soon…\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The skill ‘Iron Will’ nullifies the status effects (Confusion, Nausea, Headache).]\n\n“Ugh, haa…”\n\nThe seizure subsided quickly as Iron Will activated.\n\nI took a deep breath to shake off the terrible aftereffects and examined my body.\n\nI immediately recognized the true value of ‘Extrasensory.’\n\n“…”\n\nIt was a strange sensation.\n\nIt felt like all my senses were amplified several times over.\n\nMy body was light, and the world seemed to move in slow motion.\n\nI could feel every contraction and relaxation of my muscles as I moved.\n\n‘This is… unique skill 1, Extrasensory.’\n\nAs I marveled at its remarkable ability,\n\n-Whoosh!!\n\nI heard the sound of something sharp flying towards me from behind at high speed.\n\nI effortlessly twisted my body and dodged it.\n\n-Thud!\n\nA spear embedded itself in the ground.\n\nI turned my head and saw Ariel casting the attack as I had requested.\n\n“Descend.”\n\nWith her final chant, the countless ice spears that filled the sky began to fall.\n\nLike a shower of light blue rain.\n\nTheir target was, of course, where I stood.\n\nI released Sorrow and assumed a stance, holding the training sword.\n\n-Whoosh!!!\n\nHundreds of sounds tore through the air, assaulting my eardrums.\n\nI could feel every single groove of the hilt against my palm.\n\nI surrendered myself to the wave of sensations.\n\nAt the same time, I swiftly rolled to the side.\n\n-Crack! Boom! Crash!\n\nDozens of spears pierced the spot where I had been standing.\n\nI quickly got up and raised my sword diagonally.\n\n-Clang! Boom!\n\nTwo spears, aimed at my shoulder, were deflected by my angled blade.\n\n‘…That was close.’\n\nMy hand, empowered by Extrasensory, moved as if it were one with the sword.\n\nThe vibrations from the sword heightened my focus.\n\n-Whoosh!!\n\nA cascade of spears rained down, giving me no respite.\n\nI backpedaled, deflecting the incoming ice shards one by one.\n\n‘Three from the front in 0.4 seconds.’\n\nFive from above in 0.7 seconds.\n\nTwo from behind in 1 second.\n\nFour from both the right and left in 1.4 seconds.\n\n-Clang! Clang! Crack!!\n\nCalculation, measurement, conclusion, action.\n\nMy accelerated brain made swift judgments, guiding me out of danger.\n\nMy hearing and touch alerted me to attacks coming from my blind spots,\n\nand my vision helped me see through the complex magic formations.\n\n-Shhhk!\n\nA sound from behind.\n\nI smoothly spun my body.\n\n-Thwack!\n\nA spear grazed my cheek.\n\nThe chill of the ice lingered on my skin, where the tip had almost touched.\n\n“Wow…”\n\nAriel gasped, impressed by the scene.\n\nI smiled leisurely and swung my sword again.\n\n‘Though I’m far from being leisurely right now.’\n\nThe barrage of attacks was so intense that it felt like I could be hit at any moment.\n\nI was merely minimizing my movements for maximum efficiency,\n\nwhich made it appear as if I was effortlessly dodging the attacks.\n\n‘Maintaining a poker face is also an important aspect of a match.’\n\n-Boom! Whoosh!! Thud!\n\nI suppressed my ragged breathing and swung my arm.\n\nDodging, deflecting, parrying.\n\nNot a single wasted movement.\n\nEvery action was imbued with purpose and strategy.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[3 minutes remaining for the special skill ‘Extrasensory.’]\n\nIt felt like an hour had passed, but it had only been 7 minutes.\n\nMy heightened perception seemed to be slowing down my sense of time.\n\nI focused my gaze, ready to end this spar.\n\n-Clang, crack…! Thud!!\n\nThe number of spears remaining had dwindled to about ten.\n\nI reduced their number one by one.\n\nSplitting the incoming ice shards in half,\n\nand making those with overlapping trajectories collide and shatter against each other.\n\nAs I struck the last spear with the pommel of my sword, shattering it,\n\n-Ding!\n\n[‘Extrasensory’ has been deactivated due to the time limit.]\n\nExtrasensory’s duration had come to an end.\n\nI collapsed to the ground, reading the status window’s message.\n\n“Huff… Huff…”\n\nMy burning lungs craved oxygen.\n\nPerhaps due to the skill’s backlash, a loud ringing filled my ears.\n\n‘…I can’t do this twice in a row.’\n\nEven a full day of stamina training would be less exhausting than this.\n\nMy head and eyes ached,\n\nand the intense movements made me feel nauseous.\n\nAs I patted my churning stomach, trying to calm it down,\n\nAriel, who had been standing at a distance, hurried over to me.\n\n“Brother! Are you okay?!”\n\n“Yeah… I’m okay… Ugh…”\n\n“Did you push yourself too hard…?”\n\nYou’re telling me.\n\nI took Ariel’s outstretched hand and got up.\n\nMy muscles screamed in protest.\n\n“…I’m dying.”\n\nI mumbled, and Ariel puffed out her cheeks and said,\n\n“You were the one who boasted that you’d be fine…”\n\n“Sorry, sorry. I didn’t expect it to be this intense.”\n\nI gave her a weak smile and patted her head.\n\n“H-Hey…! Your hand is sweaty! It’s getting on my hair…!!”\n\nShe hissed like a cat.\n\nI couldn’t help but chuckle at her feisty reaction.\n\n“Shall we head back?”\n\nI asked, massaging my stiff shoulder.\n\nAriel tilted her head, looking surprised.\n\n“Already? It’s only been two hours.”\n\n“It feels like a lot longer.”\n\n“Well… yeah, but you usually spend at least six hours in the training ground, don’t you?”\n\nSix hours…?\n\nI stayed there that long?\n\nThat meant I spent almost all day training, except for class and sleep…\n\n‘…Is this a habit from my previous life?’\n\nI was unconsciously obsessed with training. Compulsion is a scary thing.\n\nI swallowed the bitter aftertaste and shrugged.\n\n“There are days like this too. Besides, I’m really exhausted today.”\n\n“Really…?”\n\n“Oh, right. Do you want to come to my dorm? Rachel has been whining about wanting to see you.”\n\n“Rachel?! Rachel is at the Academy?!”\n\nAriel exclaimed in surprise.\n\nI tilted my head at her reaction and asked,\n\n“Didn’t I tell you? Rachel is my personal maid now.”\n\n“Whaaat?!”\n\nAs we were chatting and heading towards the carriage stop,\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“Ah.”\n\nAriel froze in her tracks, her eyes meeting someone’s gaze.\n\n“Ariel? What’s wrong? Do you know them…?”\n\nI followed her gaze and couldn’t help but stop as well.\n\nBecause standing before us were unexpected figures.\n\nA boy with golden hair and eyes,\n\nand a girl with deep blue hair and eyes.\n\nA boy and a girl I knew all too well.\n\nMajor characters from the original novel, [Sorrow-erasing heroes].\n\nThe protagonist, Allen Reinhardt.\n\nAnd Clara Misoph, Allen’s heroine and the top student in our year.\n\nThe characters I had only seen through the pages of a book were now standing face to face with me.\n\n‘The protagonist… It’s the protagonist.’\n\nThe one I admired,\n\nthe one who brought back cherished memories.\n\nFor a moment, an indescribable emotion surged within me.\n\nHowever, my sentimentality was shattered by Clara’s first words to Ariel.\n\n“Well, well, well.

If it isn’t our runner-up.”\n\n“You…!!”\n\n“Oh my, so sharp… You’re shaking after just a few words.”\n\nClara and Ariel were openly hostile towards each other.\n\nI hurriedly pulled myself out of my daze, startled by their confrontation.\n\n‘What’s going on…? Were they always on bad terms?’\n\nI knew from the original story that Clara, the top student, often clashed with the runner-up,\n\nbut their current glares seemed ready to escalate into a full-blown slapfight.\n\nThis is strange. Ariel isn’t the type to fight with anyone…\n\n“Top student by a mere 3 points…”\n\n“At least you admit you’re beneath me, right?”\n\n“Grrrr…!!”\n\nAriel was losing the exchange badly.\n\nClara, seemingly enjoying the sight, mocked Ariel with a sneer.\n\n“No matter how hard you try, you’ll only ever be chasing my tail. Why don’t you just give up now?”\n\nAt this point, it was clear who the problem was.\n\nClara, she was the problem.\n\nI sighed deeply and brushed my hair back.\n\n‘…Well, I guess Ariel must be an eyesore to her.’\n\nClara, with her obsessive desire for the top spot, would naturally be wary of Ariel, whose grades were similar to hers.\n\nMoreover, Ariel belonged to the Lishite family,\n\nwhich had a bad relationship with Clara’s own Misoph Marquis family.\n\nBesides all that, she was just a terrible person.\n\n‘She must be even worse at this early stage of the original story.’\n\nSharp-tongued, prickly, and enjoying her malicious behavior.\n\nThe national team senior who recommended the book to me used to love these kinds of “tsundere” characters.\n\nI didn’t get it.\n\nI didn’t particularly hate Clara, but I didn’t like her either.\n\n“Clara…! How can you talk to Lady Ariel like that…!!”\n\n“Hmph, what’s it to you?”\n\n“Sigh… I apologize, Lady Ariel.”\n\nOur protagonist, Allen, intervened, trying to restrain Clara while glancing at Ariel.\n\nYes, Allen, you have your work cut out for you.\n\nAt this point in the story, he must be getting tossed around by the heroines.\n\nAllen met my gaze, which held a mixture of emotions.\n\nHe stiffly pulled Clara’s hand.\n\n“…”\n\n…He’s wary of me, not Ariel.\n\nWell, it would be awkward to see a third-rate villain you thought you defeated reappear in front of you.\n\nStill, that wary look in his eyes hurts a little.\n\n“We’ll be taking our leave. Have a good day, both of you.”\n\n“W-Wait, Allen…! You’re suddenly holding my hand…!!”\n\nClara blushed as Allen unexpectedly grabbed her hand.\n\nShe was soon swept away by him, completely smitten.\n\nAriel watched them with a dumbfounded expression.\n\n“…I hate them.”\n\n“You should get along with your friends.”\n\n“Do they look like friends to you?”\n\n“…”\n\nI couldn’t bring myself to nod.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOur first encounter with the protagonist was unexpectedly chaotic.\n\nWe left the scene behind and headed back to the dorm.\n\nRachel greeted Ariel enthusiastically when we arrived. Seeing their affectionate interaction warmed my heart.\n\nYes, this is what a friendship should be like.\n\nActually, it felt more like a nanny and child relationship,\n\nbut Ariel would sulk if she heard me say that, accusing me of treating her like a kid.\n\n“Uwaaaah!! Rachel, let go of me…!”\n\n“Hehe~ You’re so cute, my lady…!!”\n\n“Aaahhh..!!”\n\nI leaned back in my chair, watching Ariel being devoured by Rachel in real time.\n\nDespite the minor incident, it was another peaceful day.\n\nI trained with Ariel, and tested out the special skill ‘Extrasensory,’\n\nand unintentionally made acquaintance with the protagonist.\n\n‘…Though Allen seemed uncomfortable around me.’\n\nStill, it was a pretty fulfilling day.\n\nAs I was reminiscing about the day’s events, basking in the pleasant exhaustion,\n\na familiar mechanical sound rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Main Quest Issued!]\n\n“Ah.”\n\nRight, there was this.\n\nA new main quest.\n\nI had missed it earlier because I was at the training ground.\n\n‘Well, the content is predictable.’\n\nI reached out and clicked on the small text box.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Main Quest Issued!]\n\nTitle: For Your Past Self\n\nObjective: Prevent the ‘First Princess Assassination Attempt’ that will occur in a week.\n\n[Reward: 500 points]\n\n[Penalty for Failure: None]\n\nCondition: Resolve the incident using only your own strength.\n\n※If you violate the condition, the quest will automatically fail, and the target, ‘Lucy von Lietro,’ will inevitably die.※\n\n[Time Remaining Until Quest Start: 3 days 1 hour 36 minutes]\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nThe quest content was as I had expected.\n\nThe Academy banquet held to celebrate the end of the midterm exams in a week.\n\nThe ‘First Princess Assassination Attempt’ that occurred there was the biggest event in the story during Allen’s first year.\n\nI remember the story taking a darker turn after this incident.\n\n‘But I didn’t expect this.’\n\nMy eyes were fixed on the quest condition.\n\n-Resolve the incident using only your own strength.-\n\nIn other words, I was forbidden from informing the faculty about the assassination attempt.\n\nAllen also received quests with this kind of condition from time to time.\n\n‘This is going to be a pain.’\n\nNot being able to utilize the Academy’s forces was a significant handicap.\n\nIt meant I had to face all the upcoming challenges alone.\n\nWell… I guess the System would allow the professors to intervene later in the event,\n\nbut by then, Lucy would likely be dead.\n\n“…”\n\nHonestly, I could just ignore this whole incident.\n\nEven if I failed this quest,\n\nthere was no penalty for me other than Lucy’s death.\n\nPlus, the world would flow according to the original story, allowing me to prepare for future events more proactively.\n\n‘…But even if I think like that, I’ll end up going anyway.’\n\nEven if it was just Raiden’s memory,\n\nI didn’t want to see someone who was once close to me die.\n\nMoreover, if I successfully resolved this incident, I could potentially lighten the dark atmosphere of the original story.\n\nThere was no reason not to go.\n\n‘I need to prepare to some extent.’\n\nI got up from my seat, organizing my thoughts.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThat evening,\n\nI finished dinner and headed straight to the first-year dormitory.\n\nI had no other reason than to meet our protagonist.\n\nI needed to give him a little warning before the big event.\n\n‘Of course, because of the condition, I can’t tell him about the assassination attempt.’\n\nBut the First Princess Assassination Attempt wasn’t the only thing happening that day.\n\nThe Saintess and the Second Princess, enjoying the banquet with a group of juniors, would also be caught up in an assassination attempt.\n\nFortunately, as the word ‘attempt’ implied, Allen would heroically save them…\n\n‘I need to minimize unexpected situations as much as possible.’\n\nIt would be arrogant to believe that everything would go smoothly.\n\nIt would be all for nothing if I saved Lucy, only for the Saintess and the Second Princess to die.\n\nSo I needed to warn Allen.\n\nTo stick close to the Saintess and the First Princess.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "…Actually, at this point in the story, Allen was unconsciously attracting girls left and right, so the heroines wouldn’t leave his side anyway.\n\nBut I still felt uneasy.\n\n“But this feels a bit…”\n\nLike I’m cleaning up after him.\n\nI had a contract with the System, so I had to do my best, but it still felt strange.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Do you want to be the protagonist?]\n\n“I never said I was dissatisfied with my current role… Well, I don’t know.”\n\nProtagonist.\n\nIt was a word I once admired,\n\nbut now I knew it was too far removed from who I was.\n\nThe protagonist had his own burdens to bear.\n\n“If I became the protagonist, the whole world might turn into a tragedy.”\n\nBecause that’s how it had been so far.\n\nI chuckled lightly, joking.\n\n“…I’m content with being Extra A in a peaceful village.”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[That’s humble of you.]\n\n“Humble? That’s still too much for me.”\n\nAfter a few minutes of conversing with the System in front of the dormitory entrance,\n\nI saw a blonde boy approaching the building from afar.\n\nHe always had a lively entourage around him.\n\nWell, he had a charm that drew people in.\n\nHe was just like the protagonist of the novel I loved.\n\nIt was a little sad that he froze the moment our eyes met.\n\nBut what could I do?\n\nI raised my hand in greeting with a nonchalant expression.\n\n“You’re here.”\n\n“…Lord Lishite?”\n\nAllen stood there dumbfounded, while the four heroines behind him glared at me.\n\nIgnoring their hostility, I greeted them as well.\n\n“What an honor to be graced by your presence.”\n\nThe Empire’s Second Princess, Neria von Lietro.\n\nThe Holy Kingdom’s next Saintintess, Lorraine Marlena.\n\nClara Misoph, the eldest daughter of the Misoph Marquis family and the top student in the first year.\n\nAnd lastly, the second daughter of Duke Roben, Eivy Roden.\n\n‘I’m the eldest son of a Duke too.’\n\nIt was a crazy harem, with two of them outranking me in status and the other two almost equal.\n\nIf these people got into a catfight, the continent would be in chaos.\n\nI pushed those useless thoughts aside and bowed my head.\n\n“This humble servant, blessed by His Majesty’s grace, greets the Empire’s second star.”\n\n“…Greetings. Raise your head, Lord Lishite.”\n\nHer words and expression didn’t match.\n\nShe looked like she had seen something unpleasant.\n\nWell, from Neria’s perspective, who cherished her older sister dearly, Raiden must be an eyesore.\n\nStill, it was a bit bitter.\n\nWhen they were younger, Raiden, Lucy, and Neria used to play together quite often.\n\n“May Tinamius always bless you. This humble creation of God greets the noble will.”\n\n“May Tinamius bless you. It’s good to see you, Raiden. You seem quite different from the last time we met.”\n\nLorraine, the Saintess, smiled awkwardly at my polite greeting.\n\nIt was bold of her to address the eldest son of a Duke by his first name,\n\nbut as a Saintess, she received treatment similar to that of the imperial family, so it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nIt also aligned with the Academy’s principle of not discriminating between nobles and commoners.\n\nStill, she was the most amicable one in the group.\n\n“Lady Roben, and Lady Misoph. It’s been a while.”\n\n“Yes, Lord Lishite.”\n\n“…Greetings to the Empire’s Sword.”\n\nEivy responded curtly, while Clara bowed her head as if she had no choice.\n\nThose two probably didn’t have good feelings towards Raiden either.\n\nIt had only been six months since Raiden had pestered and bothered the heroines.\n\nThey must be thinking, ‘Here we go again.’\n\nDon’t worry, I have no interest in you whatsoever.\n\n“May I have a word with you in private, Young Master Reinhardt?”\n\n“…A word, sir?”\n\nAllen gulped.\n\nHis golden eyes wavered.\n\n“You’re too tense. Don’t worry, it’s nothing important.”\n\n“Y-Yes… Let’s move somewhere else then.”\n\nContrary to his initial reaction, Allen nodded quite readily.\n\nIt was only natural. How could a mere third son of a Viscount refuse a Duke’s request?\n\nEven Neria, who clearly disapproved, remained silent.\n\n“It’ll be brief. I promise I won’t do anything harmful.”\n\n“Yes…”\n\n“Do you need me to pinky swear for you to believe me?”\n\n“N-No! I apologize!!”\n\nThe boy and the girls flinched as I frowned at their lukewarm response.\n\nThey seemed more intimidated than I expected, but I understood.\n\nRaiden was indeed scary when he frowned. He naturally had a cold expression.\n\n“Follow me.”\n\nI left with the blonde boy.\n\nWhen we reached a secluded alley, I stopped walking\n\nand began to get to the point, addressing Allen, who was on high alert.\n\n“Allen Reinhardt.”\n\n“Yes, Lord Lishite.”\n\n“The third son of the Reinhardt family… and the chosen hero of this generation.”\n\n“…!?”\n\nConfusion clouded his golden eyes.\n\nHe must have been caught off guard.\n\nAt this point in the story, no one but Allen himself knew that he was the hero.\n\nI continued, looking at the boy’s pale face.\n\n“A trial will begin soon.”\n\nIf you don’t want to lose anyone, follow my words.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I shall stand at the forefront.\n\nWith these words, a man appeared.\n\nHis name was Ash Reynolds.\n\nThe Primordial Hero.\n\nAppearing like dawn amidst the pitch-black darkness, he confronted the Demon King’s army.\n\nThe Hero's miracles repelled the demon forces time and again.\n\nThe brilliant radiance that embroidered the sky with every swing of his sword gave hope to the weary Allied Forces.\n\nThe Hero and his comrades gradually began to drive back the darkness.\n\nWarm sunlight began to reach the battlefield, which had always been awash in blood and shadow.\n\nThe burning continent stabilized.\n\nAnd then.\n\nAt the end of the long, long night.\n\n-You've come this far, Hero.\n\nLight and darkness finally faced each other.\n\nThey looked into each other's faces, filled with sorrow, and declared this to be the end.\n\n-This battle… shall be the final salvation.\n\n-You still cling to hope. Impressive.\n\nThus clashed the Demon King and the Hero.\n\nIt was no exaggeration to say that their duel shook the very foundations of the world.\n\nMountains crumbled with a single punch.\n\nOceans split with a single swing of the sword.\n\nThey fought for eight days and nights straight.\n\nAnd then.\n\nThe Hero's final strike, unleashed with all his life force, finally pierced the Demon King's heart.\n\nThe Primordial Light, having fulfilled its duty, closed its eyes with a relieved smile.\n\nAnd the Demon King…\n\n-You’ve won. Or perhaps… it’s a draw.\n\n-But do not be too complacent, world.\n\n-I shall return to shatter your peace and complacency.\n\n-Remember the fear that I have wrought.\n\nIt maintained its composure even as its body crumbled into dust.\n\nThe Primordial Darkness, cursing the world it had sought to conquer until its very last breath, vanished.\n\n-My name is Lugetina. Lugetina Tov Di Atrahasis.\n\n-The sorrow that will consume the world.\n\nAnd so.\n\nWith the mutual destruction of the Hero and the Demon King, peace was restored to the world.\n\nThis is the story of the Primordial Hero.\n\nThe idol of all.\n\nAsh Reynolds.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd now, 1,000 years later.\n\nA boy was chosen as the new Hero.\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nAllen, lying on his bed and staring blankly at the ceiling, let out a long sigh.\n\nHe buried his face in his blanket and tossed and turned.\n\nAllen Reinhardt.\n\nAn honor student who consistently ranked third in his year at Reynolds Academy, the continent’s most prestigious educational institution.\n\nA promising prospect, is considered to have the greatest potential among the students of this cohort.\n\nA boy loved by all for his handsome appearance and diligent personality.\n\nBut Allen harbored a secret…\n\n“Status window.”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You have been chosen as the ‘Hero’ of this generation.]\n\n[Strengthen yourself to prevent the impending resurrection of the Demon King.]\n\nHe was the chosen Hero of this generation.\n\nThe boy tapped the blue window that appeared before him a few times\n\nand sighed once more.\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nA lament a little longer than before.\n\nAllen's mind was filled with complex thoughts.\n\nFive years had passed since he gained the strange power called the ‘status window.’\n\nFive years had passed since he had shouldered the fate of the Hero.\n\nDuring that time,\n\nAllen hadn't told anyone about his destiny.\n\nThe first reason was that no one would believe him.\n\nThink about it.\n\nWho would believe a twelve-year-old kid?\n\nThey would just think it was a childish prank.\n\nAnd the second reason.\n\nIf it became known that he was the Hero, would those around him leave him alone?\n\nThe demons would undoubtedly do everything in their power to eliminate him.\n\nMoreover, there might be people who would try to exploit the Hero.\n\nFor his own safety and the safety of those around him, he had to keep his identity as the Hero a secret.\n\nFor five years, Allen had meticulously guarded his secret.\n\nHowever, an unexpected variable had appeared before the boy.\n\n-Allen Reinhardt.\n\n-The third son of the Reinhardt family… and the chosen Hero of this generation.\n\nRaiden Lishite.\n\nThe eldest son of the Lishite Dukedom, the infamous delinquent of the Empire.\n\nAnd the villain he had personally executed through a quest.\n\nHe knew Allen's true identity.\n\n“How…?”\n\nAllen murmured quietly, his heart heavy with bewilderment.\n\nThere should have been no one who knew his true identity.\n\nHe hadn’t breathed a word to his childhood friend Clara, let alone his family.\n\nBut Raiden Lishite…\n\nHow did he know?\n\nThat wasn’t the only thing that bothered him.\n\nWhile others seemed oblivious, Allen could see Leiden with the 'Hero’s Eyes.'\n\nHe could see the chilling aura emanating from the boy.\n\nA pressure that felt like pent-up rage.\n\nIt was a violent force that made him wonder if such twisted power could truly exist.\n\nThat’s why Allen couldn’t help but freeze whenever his eyes met Raiden’s.\n\nThose pupils, devoid of any light,\n\nseemed to contain an abyss, chilling him to the bone.\n\n“He wasn’t like that just six months ago.”\n\nAllen remembered.\n\nRaiden’s frail and unimpressive appearance.\n\nHis mana capacity was meager, his body weak.\n\nBut the Raiden who returned was a completely different person.\n\nActually, not much had changed physically.\n\nAt most, his body had gained a bit of muscle.\n\nEven that was barely noticeable.\n\nBut just making eye contact with him made Allen feel like all his senses were on high alert.\n\n“…He must have gotten his hands on some dangerous power.”\n\nA power that could overwhelm even Allen, who possessed the A-rank passive skill 'Hero’s Will.'\n\nA hidden power that remained invisible to ordinary people.\n\nAllen sensed that things were taking a sinister turn.\n\nFurthermore,\n\n-A trial will begin soon.\n\n-If you don’t want to lose anyone, follow my words.\n\n-At the Academy banquet in a week, stay close to the Saintess and Her Highness the Princess. Never leave their side.\n\nRaiden spoke with a knowing tone.\n\nAllen couldn’t help but nod at the boy's chilling assertion, which sent shivers down his spine.\n\n“What’s going to happen…?”\n\nAllen dryly washed his face, his mind swirling with questions.\n\nThe atmosphere at the Academy was peaceful, and his status window offered no clues.\n\n“Status window, is something going to happen in a week?”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[No relevant information exists.]\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nEven the status window, which usually knew everything, was unhelpful. It was beyond frustrating.\n\nAllen felt like he was standing in the eye of a storm.\n\n“…Should I just follow his words for now?”\n\nAllen mumbled, sighing deeply.\n\nThe boy’s worries continued until the next day arrived.\n\n***\n\nThree days before the First Princess Assassination Attempt.\n\nI was going about my usual routine.\n\nSpending most of my day immersed in training.\n\nOccasionally, I ventured outside the Academy to acquire various items,\n\nbut not very often.\n\nI had plenty of money, so there were no obstacles in the purchasing process.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Anyway,\n\nmy focus was on improving my proficiency with Blink.\n\nIt was difficult to adapt to at first, but it gradually became more familiar with time.\n\nNow, I felt like I had a good grasp of it.\n\nI still made mistakes if I lost focus,\n\nbut compared to the beginning, I could execute combinations quite smoothly.\n\nYesterday, I even managed to snatch the title 'Mace Slayer' from Golden Boy.\n\nHe rolled around on the floor, whining about how much it hurt.\n\nIn the end, I had to give him a few bottles of potions.\n\n‘Alright. I’ve completed the synergy title, preparations for the assassination attempt are going well, everything’s good… but…’\n\nSomething unexpected popped up.\n\n“Greetings, Student Raiden.”\n\nA green-haired man greeted me with a bright smile.\n\nLucas Landrant, the head instructor.\n\nI looked at him with a slightly stiff expression.\n\nHe seemed to take it as a response to his greeting and smiled even wider.\n\n“Working hard as always, I see.”\n\n“Ah, yes…”\n\nWhat’s with the friendly act?\n\nI mean, Lucas was known for his affability and caring attitude towards his students,\n\nbut he didn’t need to extend that to me.\n\n“Haha, don’t be so wary. I’m your homeroom teacher, after all…”\n\n“…”\n\nWell…\n\nWary wasn’t the right word. Uncomfortable was more accurate.\n\nConsidering what Raiden had done to him in the past, it was impossible for me to treat him casually.\n\n-Student Raiden, it’s not right to bully other students. Please refrain from doing so…\n\n-SLAP!!\n\n-How dare a mere Academy instructor speak to me like that? Do you think the Duke’s family is a joke?\n\n…Damn it.\n\nI hate Raiden.\n\nI mean, I always hated him, but now I hate him even more.\n\nThis bastard. How could a student slap a teacher?\n\nEspecially one who was concerned about his well-being.\n\n‘Maybe he acted out more fiercely to push away Lucas’ kindness…’\n\nStill, this was too much.\n\nHe should have considered the person who had to clean up his mess.\n\n“Don’t worry. I’m just here to offer some advice as your homeroom teacher.”\n\n“Advice, you say…?”\n\n“Yes, advice about your unique talent, Student Raiden.”\n\n“Hmm?”\n\nAdvice about my unique talent, Blink? This unexpected statement piqued my interest.\n\nIt was understandable.\n\nRecords of those blessed by space were scarce, even if you searched the entire continent.\n\nMoreover, there was no known precedent for someone like me, with an extremely short-range teleportation ability.\n\nSo I had to develop my ability on my own rather than relying on others.\n\nAnd now, advice?\n\nIt was an enticing topic I couldn’t ignore.\n\n‘Lucas Landlanto…’\n\nYes, maybe he could help.\n\nA genius who participated in the Empire’s civil war at a young age and made significant contributions.\n\nA living legend among assassins, who established the new class of Magic Assassin.\n\nThe disciple and lover of Korn Ronezia, the most powerful Archmage of the current era.\n\nAh, for your information, that last part is a secret.\n\nThe Academy Principal’s preference is ‘raising’ someone younger… If everyone found out, they would look at him with disdain.\n\nEven though he had reached the pinnacle of magic at a young age and maintained his early twenties appearance.\n\nAn age gap of almost twenty years…\n\n‘Anyway.’\n\nA veteran with such credentials might have thought of different ways to utilize my ability.\n\nWith a mixture of hesitation and anticipation, I nodded.\n\nIt was a sign that I was willing to listen to his advice.\n\n“You’re quite obedient this time, unlike before?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Haha! Just kidding. I’ll go get some equipment, so wait here for a bit.”\n\n…Was he more resentful than I thought?\n\nMaybe I made a mistake.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nContrary to my worries,\n\nLucas didn’t seem to mind the past.\n\nHis expression remained unchanged, as if he had completely forgotten about that incident.\n\n“I’ve been observing you during classes, and you only seem to use Blink for movement or escape.”\n\n“Yes, that’s correct.”\n\n“May I ask why?”\n\nI nodded without hesitation at Lucas’ question.\n\n“Because I judged it to be the most efficient way to utilize it.”\n\nShort-range teleportation, Blink.\n\nIt sounded like a cheat-like unique talent at first glance.\n\nBut my ability had several limitations.\n\nFirst, the target I wanted to teleport had to be in contact with my body.\n\nI couldn’t affect distant objects like Bluetooth.\n\nSecond, if another object occupied the coordinates I wanted to teleport to, the ability would fail.\n\nIn other words, I couldn’t teleport to overlapping coordinates.\n\nLastly, Blink didn’t affect the state of the target.\n\nFor example, if I teleported a dagger in my hand ten meters ahead, it would simply fall to the ground.\n\nWith zero kinetic energy, it wouldn’t suddenly fly or embed itself somewhere just because its coordinates changed.\n\n‘The problem is, it’s only vaguely useful.’\n\nIt was useless at medium to long range.\n\nAt close range, it boasted incredible power, but the difficulty of manipulating the magic was equally high.\n\nIf only there was a way to counter long-range attacks…\n\n“Hmm. I think you can use that ability against long-range attacks as well.”\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“And as a reliable counter-attack.”\n\nHow?\n\nI stared at Lucas with wide eyes.\n\nThe green-haired man, meeting my gaze, grinned and asked,\n\n“It might be a bit difficult… but would you like to learn?”\n\n“…If you’re willing to teach me, Professor, I would be honored to learn.”\n\n“Good.”\n\nLucas nodded in satisfaction at my answer.\n\nHe took out various throwing weapons from his waist and began to explain.\n\n“The technique I’m going to teach you is mainly used by Magic Assassins as both a counter and a survival technique. Have you ever heard of a magic called ‘Reflect’?”\n\n“I’m hearing it for the first time.”\n\n“That’s probably the case. I developed it myself.”\n\nLucas, who had been juggling the throwing weapons lightly, tossed them to me.\n\nThey were training weapons made of a light material.\n\n“It’s faster to see it in action than to just talk about it. Student Raiden, would you throw those weapons at me with all your might?”\n\n“At you, Professor?”\n\n“Yes. It’s fine, don’t hold back.”\n\nI hesitated for a moment, but his reassurance cleared my mind of any second thoughts.\n\nHe must have a plan.\n\nI gripped one of the throwing weapons tightly\n\nand hurled it at him like a baseball.\n\n-Whoosh!\n\nThe dagger left my hand with a slight gust of wind, aimed directly at Lucas’ face.\n\nEven though I threw it with all the strength my Strength stat allowed,\n\nLucas watched the approaching weapon without a hint of flinching.\n\n“Reflect.”\n\nAs his lips uttered the incantation, a green aura erupted from his outstretched hand.\n\nThe moment Lucas lightly touched the dagger, which had reached his nose,\n\n-Clang, swoosh!!!\n\nThe dark dagger, repelled backward, grazed my cheek.\n\nThe weapon, now flying in the opposite direction, finally came to a halt after embedding itself in the wall.\n\n“…”\n\n…What was that?\n\nWhat just happened?\n\nI felt my thoughts freeze in momentary bewilderment.\n\n“So, did you see that?”\n\nLucas chuckled as if amused by my reaction.\n\nHe waved his hand, still imbued with mana, and said,\n\n“That’s ‘Reflect.’ It’s a unique magic that I developed.”\n\nAmazing, isn’t it?\n\nLucas shrugged.\n\nI wanted to nod in agreement, but my head wouldn’t move.\n\nMy mind was completely captivated\n\nby something else.\n\n‘That just now…’\n\nMy mind kept replaying the intense scene I had just witnessed.\n\nThe approaching weapon.\n\nHis fingertips lightly touching it.\n\nThe attack was instantaneously repelled.\n\n‘…No. It looked like it was repelled, but that’s not how it works.’\n\nIt was a fleeting moment, but I saw it clearly.\n\nThe moment the green mana touched the weapon, its trajectory shifted 180 degrees.\n\nIt wasn’t forcefully deflected with strength.\n\nIt was simply reversed, sent back to where it came from.\n\nAn unimaginable way of manipulating magic.\n\nThe fact that he showed me this…\n\n“…You’re suggesting I use Blink like that.”\n\n“You caught on immediately. As expected, you’re excellent.”\n\nReflect.\n\nIt was an extremely difficult technique based on the pinnacle of Wind magic and exceptional dynamic vision.\n\nBut I had a way to cheat my way through it.\n\nBlink and Extrasensory.\n\nI could substitute the highly controlled Wind magic with Blink,\n\nand the high Agility stat required for dynamic vision with Extrasensory.\n\n“It’s a technique that suits you perfectly, Student Raiden.”\n\n“Yes… It truly is.”\n\n“Actually, I’ve wanted to teach you this since we first met last year… but your attitude was a bit prickly…”\n\n“…I apologize.”\n\n“Ah, I wasn’t looking for an apology.”\n\nAs I bowed my head in guilt, Lucas looked flustered.\n\nBut then he smiled brightly.\n\n“But thank you! I never thought I’d receive an apology. You’ve really changed, haven’t you?”\n\nI scratched the back of my head, embarrassed.\n\nHe was kind, friendly, everything was good… but a bit overwhelming.\n\nHis kindness was too much to handle…\n\nAs if reading my mind, Lucas extended his hand for a handshake.\n\n“Well then, let’s get along well from now on. You’ll keep coming to learn from me, right?”\n\n“Yes… I’ll be in your care.”\n\nWith mixed feelings, I grasped his hand.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nin a building of unknown location.\n\nIn a space filled only with darkness and silence, several figures clad in robes gathered.\n\nThey exuded an air of danger as they stood around a round table, facing each other.\n\n“Soon.”\n\nThe robe at the center muttered.\n\nHe didn’t specify what ‘soon’ referred to, but his companions silently nodded in understanding.\n\n“We’ve kept our heads down for a while… but it’s time to spread our wings again.”\n\nIn three days, the entire continent will know our name.\n\nNo one can stop the march of progress.\n\nThe world will face a twisted turn of events brought about by hidden truths.\n\nJoin us, brothers.\n\nFor the new world that we and our comrades envision.\n\n“In three days, we will assassinate the Empire’s princesses.”\n\n-Thud!!\n\nWith those words, the robe slammed a knife into the imperial crest displayed on the table.\n\nFollowing his lead,\n\nthe other robes immediately drew their swords and stabbed the crest.\n\nA faint groan escaped as the symbol of the imperial family was torn to shreds.\n\nThe robe at the center twisted his lips into a grotesque smile as he watched.\n\nHe could already envision the princesses’ corpses, stained with blood.\n\nA thrill ran down his spine, making him tremble as he raised his sword.\n\n“Should a butterfly crawl on the ground?”\n\nIt’s time to take flight.\n\nSpread your wings, birds of inquiry.\n\n“For truth, for inquiry, for progress, and for a new world.”\n\n“‘For truth, for inquiry, for progress, and for a new world.’”\n\nIn the space filled only with darkness and silence,\n\ndanger was spreading its wings.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Bonus chapter thanks to @Ko-fi Supporter for subscription to 'Blink' tier on Ko-fi.First Princess Assassination Attempt (1)\n\nTime passed.\n\nFinally, the day of the main quest arrived.\n\nDressed in a formal suit, I was heading to the special hall where the banquet was being held.\n\nThe rattling of the carriage erased the surrounding silence.\n\nI stared blankly out the window, lost in thought.\n\n“…”\n\nThe First Princess Assassination Attempt.\n\nIt was the episode that marked the beginning of the main storyline in the original novel, 'Sorrow-erasing heroes.'\n\nThe ‘Seekers,’ who had been quiet for the past year, would reappear,\n\nand as their opening act, they would attack Reynolds Academy, aiming to eliminate the First Princess, the Second Princess, and the Saintess all at once.\n\nIn the original story, thanks to Allen’s efforts, the Saintess and Neria only suffered minor injuries.\n\nHowever, Lucy lost her life on the spot.\n\nFrom the moment of her death, the peaceful atmosphere of the story took a sharp turn into a tragedy.\n\nThe assassination of the Empire’s princess caused an uproar within and outside the Empire.\n\nThe Emperor, who deeply cherished his family, fell ill due to the death of his eldest daughter.\n\nHaving lost his sharp intellect and wisdom, he withdrew from politics, throwing the Empire into chaos.\n\nThe maids and knights who had been responsible for Lucy’s safety were all executed for failing to protect a member of the royal family.\n\nKorn, the principal of the Academy, was held accountable for the incident and exiled from the Empire.\n\nThis weakened the Academy’s forces,\n\nand later, it laid the groundwork for a more devastating attack on the Academy by the demons.\n\n‘…In short, if I fail to prevent this assassination, the entire Empire will crumble.’\n\nAs the story turned darker, Allen would rise to the occasion and achieve great feats.\n\nBut wouldn’t it be better if such a tragedy never happened in the first place?\n\nIt wouldn’t be easy, but if I succeeded in this quest, future events would unfold more smoothly.\n\nI began to review the details of the incident I remembered one by one.\n\n‘First, the assassins will appear at exactly 9:00 PM.’\n\nThere was no specific entry route.\n\nThey would simply appear out of thin air.\n\nYou might think the Seekers had some kind of teleportation ability…\n\nAnd you would be right.\n\nThe leader of the Seekers, like Raiden, was one of those blessed by space.\n\nIn other words, he was one of the five teleportation mages in the world.\n\n‘As far as I know, there are currently three teleportation mages.’\n\nFirst, Raiden.\n\nSecond, Allen’s supporter, who appears later in the story.\n\nAnd lastly, the leader of the Seekers, the ‘Black Priest, Illios.’\n\nAmong the three, Illios boasted the longest teleportation range.\n\nHe could traverse distances from 500 meters to 6,000 meters.\n\nOf course, as a trade-off for such a powerful ability, there was a limitation: after using it once, he couldn’t teleport again for three months.\n\nHowever, compared to the advantage of being able to deploy terrorists anywhere on the continent, it was a minor handicap.\n\n‘Then the key is… whether or not I can block the assassins’ first attack.’\n\nSince I couldn’t predict the direction of the attack, it was an extremely disadvantageous situation for the defender,\n\nbut if I could overcome that hurdle, I could steer the situation according to my plan.\n\nSo, if necessary, I had to protect Lucy even if it meant taking the hit myself.\n\n“…This is nerve-wracking.”\n\nI took a deep breath to calm my pounding heart.\n\nEmotions of unknown origin were bubbling up inside me.\n\nSadness, resentment, anger.\n\nAnd a viscous, melting-killing intent.\n\nIt seemed that Raiden’s remnants still lingering in this body were affecting me.\n\n‘Well, from Raiden’s point of view, the Seekers are the ones he wants to tear apart.’\n\nThey murdered his respected mother and pushed his life into the abyss.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, they were now trying to harm the lady he had once served.\n\n“…What a persistent ill fate.”\n\nIf it weren’t for the Seekers, Raiden’s life could have been much happier.\n\nBut don’t be too sad.\n\nI’ll save Lucy in your stead.\n\nAnd I’ll get revenge for you as well. I’ll just throw them in prison for a good long time.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[I will not intervene during combat.]\n\n[Act as you please.]\n\n“You’re saying you won’t get in my way, right?”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[That is correct.]\n\n[I hope this opportunity will alleviate some of the past sorrows.]\n\n“Haha, sorrows… You seem to forget, I’m not Raiden.”\n\nI had decided to get revenge for him…\n\nbut that was a separate matter.\n\nThere was no connection between me and his tragedy in the first place.\n\n“Sometimes, I feel like you equate me with Raiden.”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[…]\n\n[It seems I made a mistake.]\n\n[I apologize for showing you my immaturity.]\n\n“It’s okay. Don’t worry about it.”\n\nI shrugged and leaned back in my seat.\n\nIt was currently 8:00 PM.\n\nBarely an hour remained until the attack.\n\nI straightened my clothes one last time and checked the items in my pocket.\n\n-Clatter…\n\nTwo small glass vials, each filled with dark green and deep blue liquid.\n\nThey were about the size of my little finger.\n\nNext to them was a white mask.\n\nAnd lastly, a tightly folded magic scroll.\n\n“…Man, I can’t believe I spent so much money just to prepare this.”\n\nThe gold coins I spent were enough to buy a mansion belonging to a viscount family.\n\nThe main reason was that the items were scarce, and I had to pay several times the original price to acquire them.\n\nBut the base price itself was ridiculously expensive.\n\nThanks to that, my once-fat wallet had gone through a miraculous weight loss.\n\nWell, I didn’t need money anyway.\n\nI could just brush off this expense.\n\nI shook my head, dispelling the faint regret.\n\n“Almost there.”\n\nThe scenery outside the window indicated that the carriage had reached its destination.\n\nI let out a shaky breath and dryly washed my face.\n\nNow, all I could do was hope.\n\nThat everything would go smoothly.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-Neigh!!\n\nThe carriage dropped me off in front of the special hall and galloped away, its hooves pounding the ground.\n\nAfter watching it disappear for a moment, I started walking towards the banquet hall.\n\nThe surroundings were already bustling with students.\n\nThey all wanted to relieve the fatigue from the grueling midterm exams.\n\nCommoner students, in particular, would be more excited since they didn’t have many opportunities to experience a noble banquet.\n\nThe Academy also lent dresses and suits, so the financial burden on the students would be less.\n\nSeeing this, I felt that the Academy was well-managed.\n\nIn an environment where various social statuses coexisted, they were maintaining a good balance for the commoners.\n\n‘Well, it has to be this good to be called the continent’s best educational institution.’\n\nWith those thoughts, I walked through the crowd of students.\n\nPerhaps due to the unexpected appearance of the former delinquent, gazes began to gather on me.\n\nThe students glanced in my direction and whispered among themselves.\n\n-Hey, isn’t that… Young Master Lishite over there?\n\n-What…? It really is!\n\n-Didn’t Young Master Lishite usually have no interest in Academy banquets?\n\n-Yeah, I remember him calling it a lowly livestock pen filled with commoners…\n\n-By the way, this is the first time I’ve seen Young Master Lishite dressed up like that.\n\n-Right… He looks amazing.\n\n-He’s just overshadowed by handsome guys like Allen and Professor Lucas. But if you think about it, Young Master Lishite is quite good-looking…\n\n-Hey, hey! Get a grip, girl!! That’s Young Master ‘Lishite’ we’re talking about!\n\n-I’m not saying I like him! He’s just handsome!\n\n…Did they realize that I could hear everything they were saying?\n\nIt wasn’t outright slander, but it felt strange.\n\nIgnoring the buzzing atmosphere, I showed my student ID to the guard standing at the main entrance of the special hall.\n\n“Raphael class, Raiden Lishite.”\n\nThe guard froze for a moment after hearing my name,\n\nthen opened the way with a stiff smile.\n\n“Enjoy your time.”\n\nI responded with a slight nod and entered the banquet hall.\n\nUnlike the chaotic outside, the atmosphere inside was relatively calm.\n\nSince the children of dukes and even princesses were present, everyone was being careful with their behavior.\n\n“I need to hurry a bit.”\n\nIt was already 30 minutes before the attack.\n\nIt seemed I had spent more time at the entrance than I expected.\n\nI took out the mask from my pocket.\n\nA masquerade mask that covered my eyes and nose.\n\nA pure white mask reminiscent of the Phantom of the Opera.\n\nI put it on.\n\nRaiden was too famous.\n\nAnd not in a good way.\n\nIf a guy like him appeared at the banquet hall and wandered around,\n\nhe would draw all the attention.\n\nMy plan was to lie low and make a surprise appearance at the exact moment the incident began.\n\nI didn't want to attract attention from the start.\n\nMany people wore masquerade masks as accessories, so it wouldn't look too out of place.\n\n“Now, all I need to do is find Lucy.”\n\nI muttered as I walked around the hall.\n\nIt wasn’t a difficult task.\n\nThere was no other girl in the Empire with such brilliant blonde hair as hers.\n\n“…There she is.”\n\nLucy was standing in the center of the banquet hall, surrounded by her followers.\n\nShe was adorned in a red dress, radiating an intense beauty.\n\nI settled down at a distance.\n\n15 minutes to go.\n\nFeeling my throat dry for no reason, I picked up a drink from the table and took a gulp.\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nIt was alcohol.\n\nI frowned and put the glass down.\n\nAs I savored the bitter taste, I could faintly hear Lucy and her followers chatting.\n\n-Haha, is that really true, Young Master Deron?\n\n-Do tell us more, Lady Leon. So what happened next?\n\n-Yes, Your Highness. At that moment, my friend and I…\n\nI listened to their conversation absentmindedly.\n\nLucy and the people around her were enjoying the banquet with cheerful laughter.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "I felt strange.\n\nA nauseating yet bittersweet feeling.\n\n“…Originally, Raiden would have been among them.”\n\nA murmur escaped my lips involuntarily.\n\nRaiden.\n\nPerhaps it was because I knew his pain.\n\nThe loneliness and sense of loss he felt seemed to be transmitted to me as well.\n\nThis was pity for him.\n\nOr perhaps empathy.\n\nCheap sympathy for two lonely souls standing side by side.\n\nOr maybe something I didn’t understand.\n\n‘Well, it doesn’t matter now…’\n\nI shook off my thoughts and came to my senses.\n\nIt was already 8:57 PM.\n\nAlmost 9:00.\n\n-Tick-tock\n\nThe sound of the second hand ticking echoed in my ears.\n\nI took a deep, controlled breath and sharpened my senses.\n\nTiming was crucial.\n\nI only had one chance.\n\n-Tick\n\nThree seconds until the attack.\n\n-Tick\n\nTwo seconds.\n\n-Tick\n\nOne second.\n\n-Tick, Dong!\n\nNow.\n\n“Blink × 6.”\n\nI chanted the spell the moment the clock struck 9:00 PM.\n\nMy vision flickered with the sound of electric sparks.\n\n-Crackle!\n\nThe next moment, Lucy’s startled face appeared before me.\n\nBefore she could react, I extended my leg and kicked her slender body.\n\n“Oof…?!”\n\nWith a gasp, the blonde girl collapsed to the floor.\n\nI didn’t stop there.\n\nMy fingertips glowed with blue mana. I chanted again, swinging my arm.\n\n“Reflect × 4!!”\n\n-Crackle…!! Thud! Thunk!!\n\nThe magic I unleashed instantly deflected the arrows flying towards Lucy.\n\nI couldn’t pinpoint the attackers’ location in that short time,\n\nso I just altered the arrows’ trajectory towards the ground.\n\nBut that was enough.\n\nLucy, the target I needed to protect, was safe and unharmed.\n\nHowever, there was a slight problem…\n\n-Kyaaaak!! Where did those arrows come from?!\n\n-Someone’s been hit!!\n\n“Cough…”\n\nI wasn’t unscathed by the barrage of arrows.\n\nA burning pain shot through my lower abdomen.\n\nI coughed dryly and looked down to see four arrows piercing my stomach.\n\nIt seemed my proficiency with Reflect wasn’t enough to completely deflect them.\n\nAs expected… mastering a unique magic in three days was too much to ask.\n\nI stared at my white shirt, rapidly staining crimson, with a sense of detachment.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Special effect ‘Pain Oblivion’ activated.]\n\n[All physical pain will be reduced by 99% for the next 30 minutes.]\n\n‘Good thing I bought this in advance.’\n\nA special effect I purchased from the status window shop for a hefty 500 points.\n\nWith this, I could fight much more effectively.\n\nNot feeling pain in battle was a huge advantage.\n\n-Crack, pull!!\n\nI roughly pulled out the arrows embedded in my stomach one by one.\n\nI heard screams around me, but I paid them no mind.\n\nThis was an urgent situation.\n\nNow that their first ranged attack had failed, they would appear in person soon.\n\n-Pull, crunch!! Crack!\n\n-Kyaaaak!!\n\n-H-He’s crazy…! Why is he doing that?!\n\nG-Guards! Someone go get the guards!!\n\nGive it up.\n\nJust stay back and conserve your energy.\n\nThis hall is currently isolated by a top-tier barrier.\n\nNo matter how much you bang on the door, it won’t open.\n\nThe professors could resolve the situation if they intervened…\n\nbut it would take at least 14 minutes, considering the time it would take them to arrive and disable the barrier.\n\n‘I have to assume there will be no outside help.’\n\nI muttered as I pulled out the last arrow.\n\nCrimson pieces of my intestines clung to the barbed arrowhead.\n\nAs expected of a weapon designed for assassination, it was quite gruesome.\n\nMy stomach was torn open, and things that shouldn’t be spilling out were spilling out.\n\n“Cough, ugh… *Spit*.”\n\nIt was a bit too grotesque.\n\nNo wonder everyone was screaming.\n\nI didn’t feel the pain thanks to Pain Oblivion. It just felt like a slight tingling.\n\nI spat out the blood rising up my throat and rummaged through my pocket.\n\nI took out the two little finger-sized vials, popped them open without hesitation, and threw them into my mouth.\n\n-Crunch…!!\n\nThe vials shattered, filling my throat with thick liquids.\n\nAs I swallowed them, a familiar mechanical sound rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[‘High-Grade Regeneration Potion’ consumed.]\n\n[Restores all body parts with a damage rate of 80% or less.]\n\n[‘High-Grade Mana Potion’ consumed.]\n\n[Fully restores depleted mana.]\n\nImmediately after those messages appeared before my eyes,\n\nthe bleeding from my abdomen stopped, and it began to regenerate to its original state.\n\n-Crackle, crack!\n\nWith strange noises, the holes closed up, and my mangled insides returned to normal.\n\nThe effect was even better than I expected.\n\nIt was worth the effort and the exorbitant price I paid.\n\nI wiped my blood-soaked, sticky hands and turned around.\n\n“…Hic.”\n\nMy gaze fell upon the blonde girl, trembling helplessly.\n\nShe was sitting on the floor, tears welling up in her eyes.\n\nShe seemed quite shaken.\n\nFeeling sorry for her fragile appearance, I gently reached out and wiped her tears.\n\n“Sob…!”\n\nAh, I didn’t mean to smear blood on her.\n\nI had unintentionally left a red handprint on her pale cheek.\n\nI thought about wiping it off, but it would probably just smudge with my dirty hands, so I stopped.\n\nI patted her shoulder lightly and said,\n\n“Don’t worry, Your Highness. Your knight is here.”\n\nI offered an awkward smile.\n\nLucy’s face flushed with confusion at my words,\n\nbut my lips were already moving.\n\n“Blink × 10.”\n\n-Crackle\n\nWith a small noise, the girl’s figure vanished.\n\nLucy reappeared next to her followers.\n\nThis should be enough.\n\nThere were knights guarding her.\n\nThey all seemed alert, so they should be able to handle it even if I missed one or two attackers.\n\nOf course, it would be best if I took care of them all myself.\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nI turned around with a long exhale.\n\nIn the center of the banquet hall, figures clad in jet-black robes stood.\n\nThe purple butterfly emblem embroidered on their chests revealed their identity.\n\n‘The Seekers.’\n\nThere were seven of them.\n\nRoughly the same number mentioned in the original story.\n\nThere would be a few more where Neria and the Saintess were,\n\nbut our protagonist would be there, so they should be fine.\n\nAs I organized my thoughts and looked around, the figure at the forefront of the robed group stepped forward.\n\n“Step aside. If you don’t want to die.”\n\n“Like hell I will.”\n\nI reached into my subspace and grasped Sorrow.\n\nWith the chilling coldness I felt in my fingertips, I uttered the activation words.\n\n“Sorrow, awaken.”\n\n-Kiiiiiiiik!!!\n\nA strange cry resonated as the special skill, Extrasensory, activated.\n\nFeeling my senses heighten throughout my body, I extended my other hand into the air.\n\n“Status window, purchase ‘Ordinary Iron Sword’ from the shop.”\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Purchasing item ‘Ordinary Iron Sword’.]\n\n[30 points deducted.]\n\nA weighty grip filled my palm.\n\nA sharply honed sword now rested in my hand.\n\nI pointed the sword at the robed figures and slowly took a stance.\n\n“Ha.”\n\n“This is unexpected.”\n\n“How absurd.”\n\nPerhaps they found it amusing that a mere Academy student was blocking their path.\n\nSome of the robed figures chuckled.\n\nDespite their mockery, I kept my eyes fixed on them, unwavering.\n\n“Seekers.”\n\nA sudden silence fell.\n\nMy words seemed to momentarily freeze their reactions.\n\nThen, they glared at me, the atmosphere turning cold.\n\nOne of the robes, who appeared to be the leader, stepped forward, sword in hand.\n\n“You recognize us by the emblem on our robes alone? You’re no ordinary student, are you?”\n\n“Ha, of course I do. It’s an emblem that’s hard to miss.”\n\n“You seem to know us quite well?”\n\nKnow you well?\n\nAt that short question, the rage buried deep within my memories seemed to explode.\n\nI embraced the crimson emotions of Raiden flooding my mind and glared at them fiercely.\n\nYes.\n\nI know you very well, too well.\n\nIt’s only natural. How could I ever forget you?\n\nEvery night, I’ve been plagued by nightmares of my mother’s death, nurturing my hatred.\n\nEvery time I carved another line on my wrist, driven by unstoppable self-loathing, I cursed you.\n\nHow could I not recognize you?\n\nDon’t worry.\n\nSince that day,\n\nyou’ve been my entire world.\n\n“…Don’t you recognize me too?”\n\n“Hmm?”\n\nWas Raiden’s rage too intense?\n\nThe line separating Kim Naru and Raiden blurred, and I felt myself becoming more and more like him.\n\nMy trembling hand tightened its grip on the sword hilt.\n\n“My name is Raiden Lishite.”\n\nThe eldest son of the Lishite Dukedom.\n\nThe second Executor of the Blue Talent, protector of the Empire.\n\nAnd…\n\na vengeful spirit, grown by devouring the despair you sowed.\n\n“In the name of Philippa Lishite, the flower of the Empire and my mother,”\n\nTo avenge her death,\n\n“I will punish your sins.”\n\nI’ll tear you apart until you beg for mercy,\n\nno, until you beg for death to escape my wrath.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Bonus chapter thanks to @Reni2425 for subscription to 'Blink' tier on Ko-fi.First Princess Assassination Attempt (2)\n\nThe midterm exam period had been grueling.\n\nCommoners had to prove their worth,\n\nand nobles had to temper themselves to demonstrate the legitimacy of their blue blood.\n\nThe Academy was well aware of the students’ hard work.\n\nTo help them unwind, they held a banquet exclusively for students after each exam period.\n\nThis particular banquet was even grander and more extravagant than usual, as it was attended by the Empire’s princesses, the Saintess, and the children of each Duke’s family.\n\nThe student council and teaching assistants were exhausted from the intense preparations for the banquet,\n\nwhile the students excitedly stepped onto the fruits of their labor.\n\nHowever, all their efforts and expectations were shattered as the banquet descended into chaos.\n\n“T-Terrorists!!”\n\n“Run!”\n\n“Professors! Get the professors, quickly!!”\n\nAt the start of the banquet, the moment the bell tolled to announce 9:00 PM, assailants stormed in.\n\nStudents were thrown into disarray as they witnessed people being struck by arrows, blood splattering everywhere.\n\n“Move!!”\n\n“Quickly! Get out, quickly!!”\n\nPanicked, some students rushed towards the exits, desperately trying to escape the hall.\n\nThey frantically grabbed the doorknobs, but…\n\n-Clank, clank!\n\n“Damn it! The doors are locked!!”\n\n“Same here!”\n\n“W-Wait! It’s not locked, a barrier’s been erected inside!!”\n\nThe banquet hall was already isolated from the outside, trapped by the assailants.\n\nDespite the Academy building being fortified with multiple protective and detection spells,\n\nthe assailants’ unique magic, fueled by the blood of countless sacrifices, had managed to breach their defenses.\n\n“Don’t push!”\n\n“S-Step back a little!!”\n\nThe cheerful melodies that had filled the air moments ago vanished,\n\nreplaced by the screams of terrified students.\n\nMost of them had already retreated from the center, huddled in corners.\n\nA few students remained in their places, trying to maintain their composure, but even they couldn’t hide the look of despair on their faces.\n\nWeapons were prohibited inside the banquet hall, leaving them with no means to resist.\n\nHowever,\n\namidst the chaos, someone stood before the assailants.\n\nA young man, his face hidden behind a pure white mask.\n\nHe wielded a sword that seemed to have appeared out of thin air.\n\n-You know me…\n\n-My name is…\n\nPerhaps the empty space around them amplified their presence,\n\nbut the confrontation between the young man and the assailants felt like a scene from a play.\n\nAfter exchanging a few inaudible words, they charged at each other.\n\nSeven unidentified assailants.\n\nAnd one equally unknown student.\n\nLucy von Lishite, the First Princess of the Empire, watched the scene unfold, her eyes wide with shock.\n\n“Ra-iden…?”\n\nHer voice trembled as she whispered his name.\n\n***\n\nFurther conversation was unnecessary.\n\nOr perhaps it was, but it didn’t matter now.\n\nMy vision was already clouded with burning rage.\n\n“There’s no helping it. Don’t complain, you brought this upon yourself.”\n\nFortunately, time was of the essence for them as well.\n\nThe leader of the robed figures, his eyes devoid of emotion, muttered softly,\n\n“Kill him.”\n\n-Bang!!\n\nThe moment he spoke, one of the robes at the front kicked off the ground.\n\nA jet-black afterimage flashed before my eyes.\n\nThe next instant, his outstretched palm erupted with blazing flames.\n\n-KwaaAAAAAAA!!!\n\nA deafening roar accompanied the searing heat that grazed my neck.\n\nIf I hadn’t ducked, my upper body would have been scorched.\n\nThey were determined to kill me without mercy.\n\nJust like them.\n\nI would have been disappointed if they had shown any hesitation.\n\n“What? You dodged that?”\n\nThe fire mage, his brow furrowed in frustration, spat out the words as his surprise attack failed.\n\nI took a step back, widening the distance between us as I parried his next attack.\n\n“Just die already!”\n\nHe prepared to cast another spell, his face contorted with irritation.\n\nI swiftly reached into my pocket and pulled out a scroll.\n\nBefore the robes could react, I tore it apart, activating the magic within.\n\n-Riiiiip!!\n\nThe sharp sound of tearing paper reverberated through the hall.\n\nThe next moment, a hemispherical barrier enveloped a 20-meter radius around me.\n\n-Transcendence of the Sixth Verse, Raymon-style Defensive Magic-\n\n‘Absolute Domain’\n\nA blue barrier, emanating from the glowing scroll, enclosed the surrounding area.\n\nI found myself trapped within the magic’s domain along with the robed figures.\n\nA vicious smirk crept across my lips as I savored the success of my second plan.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Using High-Grade Scroll ‘Absolute Domain’.]\n\n[A hemispherical barrier encompassing a 20-meter radius around the caster will be formed for 10 minutes.]\n\n[Entry and exit will be prohibited until the barrier is destroyed or the duration expires.]\n\nThe banquet hall presented numerous variables.\n\nIt was teeming with potential hostages,\n\nand even the slightest provocation could easily escalate into utter chaos.\n\nThe best way to prevent such a situation and confront the enemy head-on was to…\n\n‘Isolate them in front of me.’\n\nThis scroll contained a unique magic crafted by the current Duke Phyler, known as the Shield of the Empire.\n\nIts barrier was so resilient that ordinary mages couldn’t even scratch it.\n\nIts distribution was currently prohibited due to its overwhelming power, making it incredibly difficult to obtain.\n\nI had to spend a fortune to get my hands on it.\n\nOf course, with a hefty price tag came a special feature:\n\n“Wh-What…?”\n\nMana usage was restricted within the barrier’s domain.\n\nThe fire mage let out a dumbfounded sound as the magic he was channeling dissipated.\n\nWithout hesitation, I lunged forward, grabbed him by the collar,\n\nand plunged my sword into his abdomen.\n\n-Thud…!!\n\nThe blade smoothly pierced through his flesh.\n\nA shiver ran down my spine as I felt the thrill in my fingertips.\n\nAs I stared at my blood-soaked sleeve,\n\na vivid memory from the past flashed before my eyes.\n\n-Run, Raiden!!\n\n-I’m sorry… my… ch-child…\n\nThe memory of that day, the day my life was shattered.\n\nThe image of a noblewoman, her graceful form juxtaposed with the gruesome death of a robed figure.\n\nI couldn’t help but stab the fire mage again and again.\n\n-Thud, thud!! Thunk!\n\nEach time crimson blood splattered my sleeve,\n\na euphoric sense of fulfillment washed over me, as if my brain were melting.\n\nHot tears streamed down my cheeks.\n\n“…Haha.”\n\nThis was strange.\n\nWhy was I doing this?\n\nThe pungent smell of blood and the sight of gore should have repulsed me.\n\nA profound emptiness weighed upon me,\n\nand a fleeting fear gripped my heart as I realized I had taken a life.\n\nYet, despite the shock,\n\nthis first experience of killing,\n\nbrought an intoxicating thrill.\n\n“Haha… AHAHAHAHA!!”\n\nA laugh of pure ecstasy erupted from my throat.\n\nMy lips, frozen in a grim line moments ago, stretched into a wide, unhinged grin.\n\nWhat did I look like now?\n\nIt must be grotesque.\n\nAh, I didn’t care.\n\nAll I wanted was for this joy to last forever.\n\n“Captain… what’s wrong with that guy?”\n\n“Get a grip. He may be acting crazy, but he took down Max in one blow.”\n\n“Damn it… ‘Absolute Domain,’ huh? This is going to be troublesome.”\n\nI turned my gaze towards the remaining robed figures, who were whispering amongst themselves.\n\nI dropped the mangled corpse in my hand to the floor,\n\nand with a powerful kick, charged towards them.\n\n“No time for distractions. Eliminate them quickly, take care of the target, and get out of here.”\n\n““Yes, sir!!””\n\nThe robes, including their leader, drew their swords from their waists.\n\nThe sound of steel clashing against steel filled the hall,\n\nand the bloody banquet resumed, accompanied by the gruesome symphony.\n\n***\n\n‘Absolute Domain,’ hailed as the strongest defensive magic scroll in history.\n\nWhile its barrier was as impenetrable as an iron fortress, it wasn’t entirely flawless.\n\nThere were a few ways to circumvent its power.\n\nThe first was to brute-force it, tearing through the barrier with overwhelming magic or physical strength.\n\nIt was the simplest method, but also the most difficult.\n\nThe barrier created by the Phyler family was not to be underestimated.\n\nEven the Seekers would find it challenging to shatter the magic itself.\n\nTherefore, they opted for the second method.\n\nKill the scroll’s caster.\n\nScroll magic fundamentally responded to the user’s will.\n\n‘Absolute Domain’ was no exception.\n\nIf the caster died, the barrier would immediately dissipate.\n\nGenome, the leader of the operation, believed this approach was more feasible.\n\nHe issued an order to his subordinates.\n\nKill the boy.\n\nYes, that was their plan…\n\n-Clank…!! Cling! Thud!!\n\n“Cough…”\n\n“AHAHAHAHA!!!”\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nGenome couldn’t comprehend the scene unfolding before his eyes.\n\nThe boy, consumed by madness, was butchering his comrades once more.\n\nThree corpses lay scattered around him, including Max, the first to fall.\n\n“He’s insane…!”\n\n“H-Holy shit… what the hell is that?! What is he doing?!”\n\n“Everyone, calm down!”\n\nGenome tried to regain control of his panicking subordinates, but he was just as bewildered.\n\nWhat was this boy?\n\nAfter Max was slain, the entire squad had rushed the boy, aiming to take him down.\n\nEven Genome, who usually avoided direct combat, had joined the fray.\n\nHe needed to ensure the mission’s success.\n\nHowever, the boy had met their assault with a chilling grin, effortlessly pushing them back.\n\nDespite being outnumbered, he steadily overcame the disadvantage.\n\nHe utilized the surrounding tables, chairs, and other objects to disrupt their formations and minimize the number of attackers he faced at any given moment.\n\nSometimes, he even threw liquor bottles from the floor to obscure their vision, creating blind spots to exploit.\n\nBut his opponents weren’t pushovers.\n\n-Don’t be fooled by his tricks. Surround him first.\n\n-Two of you take the bows, the rest follow me.\n\n-Keep aiming for his blind spots.\n\nThough the ‘Seekers’ primarily focused on magic,\n\nthey were elite magic assassins, carefully selected for their skills.\n\nThey possessed exceptional martial arts prowess, far surpassing that of ordinary individuals.\n\nGenome and his squad maintained their composure, gradually tightening the noose around the boy.\n\nHowever,\n\n-Damn it…!! How is this possible?!\n\n-Wait, Todd’s been caught…!\n\n-Gah, ugh…\n\nThe boy, as if it were only natural, overwhelmed them all.\n\nHe deflected their attacks from all directions as smoothly as flowing water, without even looking.\n\nEven the occasional arrows were either knocked away by his sword or effortlessly dodged.\n\nIt was as if he could calculate every detail of the space, time, and distance within the barrier.\n\n“…Ha.”\n\nGenome let out a hollow laugh in spite of himself.\n\nThe boy was staring at him, tears streaming down his face.\n\nHis lips were twisted into a grotesque, awkward smile, creating a truly unsettling sight.\n\nGenome gripped his sword once more, muttering under his breath.\n\nThat boy…\n\nNo, that ‘thing’ was a monster.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Thud!\n\nNow that I had regained my composure, my movements felt noticeably lighter.\n\nMy defenses, which had loosened, tightened once more.\n\nMy swordsmanship, which had become wild and aggressive, regained its original form, flowing with a newfound calmness.\n\n“…!!”\n\nThe assailants seemed to sense the shift in my demeanor and began to hesitate in their attacks.\n\nIt was only natural.\n\nThe aura of raw savagery differed greatly from that of controlled ferocity.\n\nI coldly addressed the robed figures I was facing.\n\n“Those clumsy attacks won’t work anymore.”\n\nIt was a form of trash talk.\n\nA statement meant to pressure my opponents and disrupt their focus.\n\nIt might seem like a trivial detail,\n\nbut building momentum was all about accumulating these small advantages.\n\n“Ha, you’re quite the smooth talker.”\n\n“I’m glad you noticed.”\n\n“If it weren’t for this damn barrier, you’d be mincemeat in a minute…!”\n\n“And which side is currently being turned into mincemeat?”\n\n“Damn you!!”\n\nOne of them lost his composure, his pride wounded by my words.\n\nAs expected of a mage, his sword hand trembled pathetically.\n\nI dodged his attack and pointed my sword at him.\n\n“Wait, Ravi…!”\n\n-Thud!!\n\nThe others tried to intervene, but it was too late.\n\nMy sword had already pierced his throat.\n\nRavi, was that his name?\n\nProbably an alias, but whatever. Farewell, you idiot.\n\n-Slice…\n\nI pulled my sword out, and his severed head tumbled to the floor.\n\nI kicked the gruesome object towards the leader of the robed figures.\n\n“Ugh, ha… ha… Now, only three remain…”\n\n“…Ha.”\n\nThe leader let out a hollow laugh, his face grim.\n\nHis eyes, fixed on me, held a mixture of complex emotions.\n\nYes, he must be dumbfounded.\n\nHis meticulously planned operation had been thwarted by a single boy.\n\nThe elite force he had brought with him was being slaughtered so easily, it must have been a crushing blow to his ego.\n\nAnd to top it all off, he was trapped by a legendary magic scroll, an encounter so rare it might only happen once in a lifetime. He must have felt incredibly frustrated.\n\nBut what could he do?\n\nLife and death were inherently like this.\n\nFleeting, fragile,\n\nvanishing without a trace.\n\nWithout even a shred of resentment left behind.\n\nMy mother, my sister Jihye, they had all left this world in the same way. And…\n\n“The Duchess Lishite, murdered by your hands, was no different.”\n\nMy actions were a form of revenge.\n\nI wanted them to experience the despair and helplessness that Raiden, that poor boy, had endured.\n\n‘Still… I think I did a pretty good job, Raiden.’\n\nI wasn’t sure if he would be satisfied, but…\n\nI hoped that the blood staining my hands\n\nbrought him at least a small measure of solace.\n\nI let out a bitter chuckle and wiped the blood off my sword.\n\n‘I need to clean up this mess and hand these guys over to the Academy… I guess I’ll capture the remaining three alive.’\n\nJust as I was about to finish off the remaining assailants,\n\nthe leader’s eyes, which had been clouded with complex emotions, suddenly flickered.\n\nHe muttered something to himself, as if struck by a sudden realization, then turned his gaze towards me.\n\n“Lishite… Raiden Lishite… So that’s how it is. I understand now.”\n\n“Surrender peacefully.”\n\n“Hey.”\n\n“I won’t listen to your bullshit…”\n\n“Does it hurt so much that your mommy died by our hands?”\n\nThis son of a bitch.\n\nHe started spouting words I couldn't have imagined.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Alright then. Let's have a little chat now, shall we?\"\n\nI stood in front of Genome, my sword still in hand.\n\nThe bastard was writhing on the floor, both his hands severed.\n\nI pressed my foot firmly on his stomach to hold him in place, and pointed my sword at his throat.\n\nGenome laughed at my actions as if they were ridiculous.\n\n\"Haha, are you going to torture me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I'm afraid you're out of luck.

I'm going to die anyway, so I don't really care.\"\n\n“…”\n\nHis relaxed demeanor made my eyes widen.\n\nMy fists were clenched tight before I knew it.\n\nA maelstrom of raw emotions churned within me.\n\nFinally, I lifted my bowed head and...\n\n\"Pfft, pff... Puhahaha!!\"\n\n…burst into laughter.\n\nAs if I had just heard something incredibly amusing.\n\nIt wasn't a sneer born of disgust, nor a chuckle born of despair.\n\nIt was pure, unadulterated amusement.\n\n\"…?\"\n\nGenome simply frowned at my reaction, staring at me.\n\nHis eyes seemed to say, ‘Has this kid finally lost it?’\n\nI coughed up a mouthful of blood before I could finally stop laughing.\n\n\"Cough, ha… My apologies. I'm not very good at controlling my emotions.\"\n\n\"Looks like you really have gone mad.\"\n\n\"Maybe I have.\"\n\nI smiled sweetly at Genome.\n\nThen, I applied pressure to the foot I had on him and spoke.\n\n\"You said your body can't feel pain, right?\"\n\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\n\"You also said I could cut you up however I pleased?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You're going to regret those words.\"\n\nThe incantation to undo the suggestion known only to the Seekers’ executives.\n\nDid they really think I wouldn't know it?\n\nMe, who had read through the story of this world hundreds of times?\n\nEspecially about your weaknesses, a part that was covered extensively in the original?\n\n\"By the will of the Seekers, I command thee...

But with a high alcohol content, it’s a different story.”\n\nThe alcohol content at which liquor starts to catch fire is around 40 degrees.\n\nThe liquor that bartenders usually use for their fire shows is around 75 degrees.\n\nOnce the alcohol content exceeds 80 degrees, it burns very easily and doesn’t go out easily either.\n\nIn other words, 89-degree liquor…\n\n“This is a liquor that catches fire very well.”\n\nIt was no different from excellent gasoline.\n\nMaybe it was because I emphasized the word ‘fire’, but he seemed to understand my intention right away.\n\n“Y-y-you crazy bastard…!”\n\n“What are you thinking? I only said it’s a liquor that catches fire well…”\n\n“Haha, don’t…!! K-kill, kill me, please!”\n\n“What are you thinking, telling me not to do something?”\n\nI gave him the same nasty smirk he had given me earlier.\n\nAll I could think about was this bastard dying in the most agonizing way possible, consumed by fear.\n\n“I’ll show you something far beyond what you’re imagining.”\n\nWith that, I smashed the top of the liquor bottle.\n\nThen, I slowly tilted the bottle over the terrified robe.\n\n-Glug…\n\nA viscous liquid flowed out with a soft gurgling sound.\n\nIt gently flowed down, soaking Genome’s right arm.\n\nAs soon as the liquor touched his arm, he let out a piercing scream.\n\n“Heeeeeek!!!”\n\nI stepped on Genome, who was trying to move, pinning him firmly to the ground.\n\nThen, I reached into my suit pocket and pulled out a few matches.\n\nA small flame flickered to life on the matchstick.\n\n“They say the most painful thing in the world is burning pain, right?”\n\n-Sizzle!\n\nThat small flicker was both beautiful and cruel.\n\n“Try your best to endure it.”\n\nThe match in my hand fell.\n\nAnd as the red snowflake gracefully drew a line, meeting Genome’s liquor-soaked right arm…\n\n-Whoosh!\n\nWith the sound of a roaring fire, a deafening scream pierced my eardrums.\n\n“Aaaaaargh!!!”\n\nThe bastard’s right arm was burning.\n\nBurning brightly.\n\nThe smell of flesh roasting wafted through the air.\n\nCrackling sounds, like branches thrown into a bonfire, escaped from his burning arm.\n\n-Crackle! Crack, crackle!\n\nAs if in excruciating pain, he convulsed, his eyes rolled back.\n\nHe struggled, trying to break free…\n\nBut really.\n\nWhat could a cripple with all his tendons severed do?\n\nHe was destined to be scorched, to endure the agony of his arm being roasted.\n\n“Aaagh! Aaaaagh!! Stoooop!!!”\n\nI leisurely savored the monstrous screams that echoed in my ears.\n\nIt was my duty.\n\nMy rightful privilege.\n\n“Ugh, ugh, uhhh…”\n\nThen, when his arm was sufficiently charred,\n\nand the flames began to spread to his torso…\n\n-Slice!\n\nI cut off his burning arm.\n\nAnd kicked it away so that it wouldn’t stick to him.\n\nWith the burning pain replaced by the agony of a severed limb, he continued to scream.\n\nI looked down at him and asked,\n\n“Why do you think I only set fire to one arm?”\n\n“Gah… Ugh, uh…”\n\n“Because it would be such a waste if you just died all at once.”\n\nThis was my first chance for revenge in years.\n\nWith that, I poured more liquor on his body.\n\nThis time, it was his left arm.\n\n“Both arms, both legs, torso, and lastly, your face.”\n\n“Uh, guh, ugh, ugh…”\n\n“Your right arm is already done… So there are only five more to go.

Everyone seems tired.\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\"Sniffle... Okay.\"\n\nAfter calming them down, I walked down the hallway.\n\nRachel and Ariel followed me, their footsteps matching mine.\n\nThe rhythmic sound of our footsteps overlapping created a strange sense of contentment.\n\n\"Why don't you two walk a little further apart?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\n\"But what if you trip......\"\n\nAs we left the main building, the carriage stop came into view.\n\nAt the same time, I made eye contact with the students already waiting there.\n\n\"......Huh?\"\n\n\"Isn't that Young Master Lishite...?\"\n\nStanding there were the main characters from yesterday's incident.\n\nThe princesses, the Saintess, and Allen.\n\n***\n\nThe chosen Hero of this generation,\n\nAllen Reinhardt.\n\nAs a key witness to the recent attempted assassination of the princess, he had been questioned along with the others and was on his way back to the dormitory.\n\nWhile waiting for the carriage at the stop, a girl standing next to him spoke up.\n\n\"By the way, Allen.

It was just a scratch on my arm.\"\n\n\"But still...\"\n\nThe girl seemed troubled by the fact that the boy had been injured while protecting her.\n\nNoticing her feelings, Allen gave her a gentle smile.\n\n\"I'm really fine. There were only three of them... I just bought some time until the professors arrived.\"\n\nAllen lowered his head, looking ashamed.\n\nSeeing his humble reaction, another girl peeked out from behind the Saintess.\n\n\"You survived for ten minutes against mages who were on par with Professor Aron, even if only for a short time. That's amazing.\"\n\nA charming girl with sun-kissed blonde hair and eyes the color of the clear sky.\n\nIt was Neria von Lietro, the Second Princess of the Empire.\n\nNeria, seeing Allen blaming himself despite successfully protecting the targets from overwhelming enemies, gave him a dumbfounded look.\n\n\"Those guys were definitely not someone a student could handle.\"\n\n\"Haha... Thank you.\"\n\n\"Just how strong are you? From what I saw, you're at least on the level of an assistant professor at the Academy... Sister, what do you think?\"\n\nNeria mumbled, turning her gaze to Lucy standing next to her.\n\nLucy, who seemed lost in thought, reacted a beat late.\n\n\"Huh...?

That person...'\n\nThere were too many strange things.\n\nRaiden knew that Allen was the chosen Hero of this generation as if it were a matter of course.\n\nHe also displayed an absurd level of power, single-handedly defeating seven enemies of a level that Allen had barely managed to handle.\n\nAnd,\n\nthat sinister aura only Allen could see.\n\nEvery time he recalled the cold energy surrounding Raiden, a shiver ran down his spine.\n\n'......He's dangerous somehow.'\n\nThe Saintess's confirmation had proven that Raiden wasn't associated with any evil entity,\n\nbut that didn't mean his vigilance towards him had disappeared.\n\nEspecially since the sight of Raiden in the banquet hall was truly shocking.\n\nAllen, organizing his complicated thoughts, categorized Raiden as a 'person of interest.'\n\n'If I meet him again, I'll have to be wary... just in case.'\n\nAllen nodded, thinking to himself.\n\nBut he didn't know.\n\nThat the encounter would happen so soon.\n\n\"......Huh?\"\n\n\"Isn't that Young Master Lishite...?\"\n\nNeria and the Saintess exclaimed in surprise.\n\nAllen looked up at the direction they were staring.\n\nThere, he saw pitch-black eyes gazing back at him.\n\n\"......\"\n\nRaiden Lishite.\n\nThe 'person of interest' Allen had just been thinking about had appeared before him.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Rachel.\"\n\nAriel lightly grabbed Rachel's sleeve as she was about to follow Raiden.\n\nThen she hesitated as if she had something to say.\n\nRachel, quick-witted, smiled gently and nodded before the girl could even speak.\n\n\"Don't worry about the young master, I'm here.\"\n\n\"......Please.\"\n\nIt seemed Ariel was worried about Raiden, who had been looking downcast since the earlier incident.\n\nRachel patted her head with an understanding expression.\n\n\"You've grown up so beautifully, Miss.\"\n\n\"What... you're only two years older than me...\"\n\nAriel grumbled but accepted her touch.\n\n\"The young master will be fine.\"\n\nRachel patted Ariel's shoulder reassuringly and stepped out of the carriage.\n\n-Screech, thud...!\n\nAs Rachel got off and the door closed, the stationary carriage started moving again.\n\nAriel thought of her brother in the rattling space.\n\n'Brother... will he really be okay?'\n\nAfter encountering Allen and Her Highness the First Princess.\n\nThe expression on her brother's face in the carriage back to the dormitory.\n\nIt was definitely...\n\n'......the face of someone who was hurt.'\n\nAriel quietly turned her head and looked at the boys' dormitory as it grew further away.\n\nWorry crept into her heart, but she forced it down.\n\n'Rachel is with him.'\n\nAriel repeated that thought, praying that Rachel would be able to comfort Raiden's heart.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

More! More!\n\n-To be tired from this much... How disappointing.\n\n-You piece of trash.\n\nBehind the voices that pounded my eardrums,\n\nthe voices I had heard at the Academy today mixed in.\n\n-Eek...!\n\n-Hey, hey, quick...!

      "content": "The Unfortunate Girl and the Unfortunate Boy\n\nOnce upon a time,\n\nthere was a girl.\n\nA girl who carried the weight of the world's misfortune on her own.\n\nThe girl had no family.\n\nHer father had run away with another woman when she was four.\n\nHer mother had been beaten to death by a client while working at a brothel when she was six.\n\nAnd her younger brother, her last remaining blood relative, had died of starvation when she was seven.\n\nBecause of this, the girl was always alone.\n\nShe had to live a fierce life with no one to lean on.\n\nShe had to beat down children in the same situation as her just to get a piece of moldy bread.\n\nThe streets were teeming with crime and poverty.\n\nThe girl struggled to survive.\n\n-Sister... I'm... hungry...\n\nThe girl remembered the warmth of her brother's hand clutching hers until his last moment.\n\nShe also remembered her own helplessness, unable to feed him anything but muddy water.\n\nThe world was vile, cruel, and filthy.\n\nDuring the day, she had to fight for food amongst a pack of starving wolves.\n\nAt night, she had to run and hide from slave traders who kidnapped pretty children, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nThe girl desperately clung to life.\n\nShe used any means necessary to protect herself.\n\nBut the world still refused to let her live.\n\n\"......\"\n\nOne winter, a particularly harsh cold settled in.\n\nThe girl finally collapsed.\n\nDeath loomed in the alleyway, filled with a chilling coldness.\n\nShe blinked her sleepy eyes and looked up at the infinitely blue sky.\n\nWhite snowflakes were fluttering down like blessings.\n\nIt was as if the whole world was mocking her miserable end.\n\nThe girl quietly closed her eyes.\n\nA hot line was drawn on her cold cheek.\n\nIf she lay here like this, she would either freeze to death or be kidnapped by slave traders.\n\nIt was a fitting end to a life that had been like a mud puddle.\n\nThe girl let go of the will to live that she had been desperately holding onto.\n\nShe wanted to stop now.\n\nShe was too tired to get up and fight the world again.\n\nHer body, stiff from hunger and cold, no longer moved, and she had no confidence that she could survive this deep, icy season.\n\nThe girl thought to herself.\n\nI will die here.\n\nAt the bottom of this filthy misfortune.\n\nOn the side of this ugly world.\n\nI will die, hating everything.\n\nI will close my eyes, cursing the whole world.\n\nThe girl repeated these words to herself.\n\nBut.\n\nWhy was it?\n\nEven though she had made up her mind so calmly.\n\nThe girl's tears wouldn't stop.\n\nNo, it seemed as if she was becoming even more heartbroken as time went on.\n\nThe girl desperately rolled her eyes in her blurring vision.\n\nShe desperately searched for someone, her gaze moving frantically.\n\nWho?\n\nEven the girl didn't know.\n\nShe just kept rolling her eyes.\n\nThe girl was dreaming a futile dream.\n\nShe was clinging to the hope that something would appear to save her.\n\nEven after living such a miserable life, she was dreaming of an extravagant hope.\n\nHowever, a wish is just a wish.\n\nNaturally, no one appeared before the girl.\n\nThe girl knew too.\n\nThat the time had come to let go of her lingering attachment.\n\nThat there was no place in this world where she could stand.\n\n\"Excuse me......\"\n\nShe had definitely thought that.\n\n\"Are you alive...?\"\n\nUntil someone spoke to her.\n\n\"......?\"\n\n\"You are alive...!\"\n\nWhen the girl opened her eyes, she saw a boy who looked to be around her age.\n\nHe had a face that was both cold and cute, and his movements exuded elegance despite his young age.\n\nAnd he had black hair and eyes, a color she had never seen before in her life.\n\nThe boy's hair and eyes, which created a mysterious atmosphere, were clearly black, yet they emitted a silver glow.\n\nThe girl stared at the boy, mesmerized.\n\nThe boy smiled softly at her.\n\nIt was a wonderful smile.\n\nIt was also an expression that no one had ever shown her in her short life.\n\n\"Look at all these wounds...! Oh, what should I do?! Here, at least wear this!\"\n\nA warm sensation enveloped the girl's body with a flutter.\n\nIt was the scarf that had been around the boy's neck.\n\nThe girl, unfamiliar with the warmth of another person, froze for a moment.\n\nThe boy, unconcerned, reached out to her.\n\n\"You don't seem to have anywhere to go... Come with me, I'll get you warmed up.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nThe girl hesitated for a moment, looking at the boy's cheeks, red from the cold.\n\nThen, with trembling hands, she timidly grabbed the boy's sleeve.\n\nThe boy smiled warmly once again.\n\nHe lifted the collapsed girl into his arms and stood up.\n\n\"My name is Raiden. What's your name?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head at the question.\n\nShe, who was born and raised at the bottom, had no name.\n\nSeeing her reaction, the boy nodded as if he understood.\n\n\"You don't have a name......\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Hmm... Then what should I call you...?\"\n\nThe boy pondered for a moment before opening his mouth.\n\n\"Rachel... How about that?\"\n\n\"......?\"\n\n\"It's your name. You'll be staying at our mansion at least for the winter, so you'll need a name.\"\n\nThe boy, suddenly giving her a name.\n\nThe girl felt puzzled by his actions.\n\n\"Is that... okay...?\"\n\nBut at the same time,\n\nthe girl thought the name wasn't bad.\n\n-Nod...\n\nAs the girl nodded silently, the boy smiled as if relieved.\n\n\"Let's go, Rachel. You're my family from today onwards.\"\n\nThe boy said as he started to walk.\n\nThe girl, somehow embraced in the boy's arms, left the streets behind.\n\nAnd so, the girl met the person who would save her life.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I could have helped with the cleaning.\"\n\n\"Hehehe~ This is a maid's job, you know~ It would be troublesome if you helped me every time!\"\n\nRachel moved the broom busily, laughing playfully.\n\nShe pointed towards the kitchen and said,\n\n\"I've prepared breakfast. It's too late to call it breakfast, though...\"\n\n\"Ah, okay... Thank you.\"\n\nI dragged my sluggish steps towards the dining table.\n\nTwo slices of toast, kept warm, were placed on the table.\n\nIt was a menu that highlighted Rachel's thoughtfulness, considering my preference for toast over sandwiches.\n\nI picked up a slice and brought it to my mouth.\n\n-Crunch...\n\nThe crispy texture of the bread hit me as I took a big bite.\n\nImmediately afterward, the rich aroma of butter and the crispness of fresh vegetables rushed in.\n\nFinally, the salty flavor of the bacon, full of saltiness.\n\nI always feel this way... Rachel's cooking is exceptional.\n\nHungry from the long sleep, I devoured my breakfast in a flash.\n\n\"Hehe... It makes me happy to see you enjoying the food!\"\n\nRachel, who had finished cleaning at some point, was standing next to me.\n\nI nodded and gave her a thumbs-up.\n\n\"It was delicious.\"\n\n\"Heehee! You always have such a good reaction, young master! It makes cooking for you so rewarding!\"\n\nRachel, with a proud look on her face, was clearing the empty dishes when she suddenly turned to me and asked,\n\n\"What are your plans for today?\"\n\n\"Plans for today? Hmm... Well...?\"\n\nI fell into thought for a moment.\n\nThe Academy had taken a week-long break due to the banquet hall attack incident.\n\nNo lectures successfully completed the quest and no immediate original story events...\n\n\"I'm going to train.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nRachel's eyes widened at my nonchalant answer.\n\nShe furrowed her brow and pouted, objecting,\n\n\"Young master, you are aware that you were discharged from the hospital yesterday, right?\"\n\n\"Uh... That's right.\"\n\n\"Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?\"\n\n\"It's okay, I'm already all healed.\"\n\nAs I spread my arms to show that I was fine, Rachel puffed out her cheeks and said,\n\n\"Even if you received treatment! Does it make sense for someone who was discharged from the hospital yesterday to go train?!\"\n\nI chuckled at her scolding, which was filled with worry, and pulled her chubby cheeks.\n\n\"Bweeee...\"\n\n\"Don't worry. I'll take it easy.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you will...\"\n\nI fiddled with Rachel's grumbling cheeks a few more times and got up from the table.\n\nWith a reluctant expression, Rachel followed me and asked,\n\n\"Are you going right away?\"\n\n\"I have to. It's almost lunchtime already.\"\n\n\"Hmm... Really, really, truly! You have to take it easy, okay?\"\n\n\"I got it...\"\n\nI escaped her nagging and returned to my room.\n\nAfter changing into light training clothes, I slung my crossbody bag over my shoulder.\n\n\"Phew... Shall we go?\"\n\nFor some reason, my heart felt light even as I headed outside.\n\nJust thinking about being the center of attention used to make me sigh, but today, those feelings felt somewhat diminished.\n\nMaybe Rachel's comforting words from yesterday had taken effect.\n\nThanks to her, I was able to leave the dormitory with a lighter step.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe training ground of Reynolds Academy.\n\nI was in the middle of the magic dummy training ground, cutting a bloody swathe through the dummies.\n\nIt was originally a training ground designed for a party of three.\n\nBut it worked out somehow even if I did it alone.\n\nIt wasn't that I was doing it alone because I didn't have any friends.\n\nIt was just a kind of hard training.\n\n-Shwing...!\n\nWith a bit of pent-up frustration, I cut down the last remaining dummy, and the training ended.\n\nCovered in sweat, I collapsed onto the floor.\n\nAs I caught my breath, I looked at the stone slab where the score was tallied, and a pretty high score was recorded.\n\n[Number of dummies processed: 2875]\n\nAt least this much should put me in the top 10% of the Academy, right?\n\nTo achieve this score without using any scrolls or magic meant that my growth rate wasn't bad.\n\n'Of course, I can't compare to Allen...'\n\nAllen is an exception.\n\nThat guy shouldn't be considered human.\n\nIf he used the Hero's power, he could probably easily surpass 5000.\n\nEven at this point, Allen possessed the martial prowess equivalent to an assistant instructor at the Academy.\n\nHe was definitely weaker than the professors, but excluding them, he could be considered the strongest in the Academy.\n\nI'm probably about 0.6 Allen.\n\nA budget version of the protagonist, what a sad reality.\n\nAs I was lost in such silly thoughts.\n\n-Clap clap clap clap clap...\n\nA frivolous sound of applause came from behind.\n\n\"Wow... 2875 points alone, that's amazing.\"\n\nTurning my head at the familiar voice.\n\nI saw a male student staring at the score with a dumbfounded expression.\n\nDyed blond hair, tanned skin, a gangster-like, laid-back atmosphere.\n\n\"The Golden Boy...?\"\n\nIt was the Golden Boy whom I had beaten to a pulp until last week to farm titles.\n\nHe grinned at my call and waved his hand.\n\n\"Yo~ It's been a week, huh?\"\n\nIt was a face I hadn't seen in a while.\n\nI hadn't come to see him since I finally earned the 'Mace Slayer' title last week.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Title - Slayer of Something]\n\n[Effect: Strength stat increases by 1 during combat.]\n\nI got the synergy title, and there was no particular reason for us to run into each other.\n\nBesides... there was something about his appearance that made me not want to be close to him.\n\nHe looked like a bad guy, the type who would stick his tongue out at someone else's girl.\n\nI frowned at the guy who was greeting me so cheerfully.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Wow... Until a week ago, you'd come looking for me and harass me even when I begged you not to, and now you scowl at me the moment our eyes meet.\"\n\n\"Ahem...\"\n\nFeeling a little guilty, I cleared my throat and made an excuse.\n\n\"That was a legitimate duel request.\"\n\n\"This guy thinks duel requests are a joke... Hey, don't duels of honor usually happen between nobles? I'm a damn commoner without even a family name.\"\n\n\"Uh, uhm...\"\n\n\"Besides, you forced me to accept even when I tried to refuse.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"We call that 'bullying.'.\"\n\nRendered speechless by his unexpectedly logical rebuttal, I quickly changed the subject.\n\n“So, why did you call me?”\n\n“Huh? Changing the subject so suddenly?”\n\n“......”\n\nSharp little bastard.\n\nAs I glared at him, inwardly scoffing, he shrugged.\n\n“Well, I figured you weren’t coming anymore, so I thought it was over.”\n\n“......Yeah.”\n\n“I mean, you were always so obsessively coming to find me, like a crazy person, so I thought something happened when you suddenly stopped. I happened to see you at the training ground, so I called you over.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nHe chuckled at my curt reply and plopped down beside me.\n\n“By the way, how’s your body?”\n\n“Hmm?”\n\nI had been subtly trying to distance myself from him, but his sudden question made me tilt my head.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“You were badly hurt during the attack.”\n\n“How did you know…?”\n\n“How could I not know? Everyone in the Academy knows by now.”\n\n“The rumors have already spread that far…?”\n\nI recalled the students I had encountered at the bus stop yesterday.\n\nMy brows furrowed involuntarily.\n\nI had a feeling the rumors weren’t going to be pleasant.\n\nI let out a sigh and asked the golden-haired boy.\n\n“Do you know what the rumors are saying?”\n\n“Of course I do. It’s pretty brutal.”\n\n“… Roughly speaking, how?”\n\n“You’re better off not knowing. More than a few students wet themselves after seeing what you looked like.”\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nRight, damn it.\n\nOf course, the rumors would spread.\n\nSome crazy bastard had burned and dismembered people while giggling.\n\nAnyone who wouldn't feel any fear after witnessing such a shocking scene seriously needed to get a mental health check-up.\n\n“Well~ the rumors are so gruesome that some students don’t believe them. But I saw it with my own eyes, so I know.”\n\nAnd sadly.\n\nThat guy was sitting right next to me.\n\nMy eyes widened at his unexpected words, and I turned to look at him.\n\n“What…?”\n\n“Yeah~! Well, that’s how it is! I saw it all!”\n\nIs this guy crazy?\n\nHow could he be so nonchalant after witnessing such a sight…?\n\nWell, it wasn’t normal for a commoner to talk so casually to the eldest son of a Duke from the start.\n\nBut to this extent…\n\nAs I stared at him with a grave expression.\n\nHe scratched his head awkwardly and spoke.\n\n“Well, the thing is… I actually heard everything back then…”\n\n“Heard? What do you mean?”\n\n“The… about Duchess Lishite, her death…”\n\n“What…?”\n\nThe second shock hit me without a moment’s pause.\n\nStruck by the sharp blow, I couldn’t help but wear a dumbfounded expression.\n\nHe heard that…?\n\nBasically, ‘Absolute Domain’ is a scroll developed for isolation or defense purposes.\n\nTherefore, the outside and inside of the domain are completely cut off.\n\nNo impurities, except for visual information and air, can pass through.\n\nNaturally, these impurities also include ‘sound’.\n\nAnd yet, the fact that he heard the small conversation between me and the investigators meant…\n\n“You… don’t tell me, you were inside the barrier at that time…?”\n\n“He… Heheh…!”\n\nThe golden-haired boy let out a silly laugh.\n\nHe flinched at my cold stare, then began to reveal the hidden truth.\n\n“Well, you see…? I was looking around the banquet hall, and suddenly I heard screams from everywhere. I thought something big was happening. So…”\n\n“So?”\n\n“I hid under a table!”\n\nIn short, this is how the incident unfolded.\n\nThe golden-haired boy, who was attending the banquet, crawled under a table as soon as the terrorist attack began.\n\nAnd because I had used the scroll nearby, he got caught in the barrier.\n\nAfter hearing the whole story, I asked seriously.\n\n“Are you… an idiot?”\n\n“Why do you ask?”\n\n“Is Your Grace an idiot?”\n\n“No, damn it. It’s not the tone, it’s the question that’s the problem.”\n\nWhy the hell would he crawl under a table?\n\nIs that some kind of earthquake drill?\n\nFrustrated, I rubbed my face.\n\nRegardless, the golden-haired boy was watching my reaction with a gleeful expression.\n\n“…You do know, right? This is an Imperial secret.”\n\n“You mean if I blab, my head will roll? Got it! I’ll keep my mouth shut!”\n\n“Not just you… your entire family could be executed…”\n\n“I’m an orphan?”\n\n“......”\n\nThis bastard has been leaving me speechless since earlier.\n\nShould I just contact my family and have them send assassins?\n\nThis is making me really anxious.\n\n“Please think and act carefully…”\n\n“Wow~! You’re worried about me? How touching!”\n\n“Sigh…”\n\nGiving up on thinking, I closed my eyes.\n\nAs I held my throbbing head for a moment, the impatient golden-haired boy poked me on the arm.\n\n“Hey, maniac.”\n\n“What is it now.”\n\n“You know~ I don’t think it was that bad?”\n\n“......?”\n\nHis usual frivolity disappeared, his voice turning somewhat serious.\n\nI couldn’t help but feel a sense of dissonance at his changed demeanor.\n\n“They were your parents’ enemies, right? It’s only natural to want to kill them as painfully as possible!”\n\n“You…”\n\n“Revenge is sweet.”\n\nFor a fleeting moment, his eyes seemed to gleam blue.\n\nBut it vanished so quickly that I wondered if it was just my imagination.\n\nInstantly returning to his usual self, the golden-haired boy gave a goofy grin and a thumbs-up.\n\n“Hehe.”\n\n“What was that… Was it my imagination?”\n\n“What’s wrong?”\n\n“It’s nothing.”\n\nI brushed off the dissonance with a bland response.\n\nThe golden-haired boy shrugged and extended his hand towards me.\n\n“Anyway! We’ve had a lot going on… but let’s get along! As fellow official outcasts of the Academy.”\n\n“Official outcasts…? What’s that?”\n\n“What, you didn’t know?”\n\nHe looked at me in surprise.\n\n“You, me, and one other guy make up the official outcast trio of the second year.”\n\n“Is that so…?”\n\n“You seem to have become a loner voluntarily… but anyway, since you’re always alone, you’re an outcast.”\n\nI nodded in understanding.\n\nThis place is like a school, after all, so bullying is inevitable.\n\nRaiden wasn’t really bullied; it’s more accurate to say that he bullied the entire Academy…\n\nAnyway, it was quite touching that my name was included in such a glorious group.\n\n“But… even if I am, why are you included?”\n\n“Me? Well…”\n\n“Did you steal someone’s girlfriend, or two-time someone, or something like that…”\n\n“No way?!”\n\nThe golden-haired boy flared up, then sighed with a complicated expression.\n\n“Everyone thinks the same thing… Well, there’s no special reason. I’m ostracized for my appearance.”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\n“My looks aren’t exactly common, are they? Some people find me unclean because I resemble a dark elf… and there’s also what you said earlier…”\n\n“…I feel kind of bad now.”\n\n“You do?”\n\nThe golden-haired boy chuckled, amused by my slightly softened tone.\n\nHe stood up from his seat and stretched.\n\n“Well… like I said before, let’s get along! As fellow outcasts.”\n\nHe gave a light wave and left the training ground.\n\nI stared at his retreating figure and fell into thought.\n\n“… Somehow.”\n\nEven when I kept seeking him out to get the title.\n\nEven though he said he hated it, he seemed to be secretly waiting for me.\n\nWas that the case?\n\nHaving resolved one question, I quietly got up from where I was lying.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“I’m home.”\n\n“Young master, young master, young master!!”\n\n“Rachel?”\n\nWhen I returned to the dormitory after training, Rachel was waiting for me at the entrance.\n\nShe was holding something in her hand, waving her arms and shouting.\n\n“A letter! A letter came for you, young master!”\n\n“Hmm? What are you talking about?”\n\n“A letter, an invitation!!”\n\n“Hold on, hold on… Calm down a bit and tell me.”\n\nI calmed down the excited girl and asked her.\n\n“So, what came?”\n\n“A letter came…!”\n\nRachel said, handing me something with trembling hands.\n\nIt was a letter adorned with luxurious patterns.\n\n“Huh…?”\n\nI froze for a moment, staring at the pattern on the letter.\n\nStrange, this pattern is definitely…\n\n“The Imperial Family!! The Imperial Family sent an invitation to the young master…!”\n\nAt Rachel’s shout, I felt my mind go blank.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Of course, I have to go.\"\n\nHe's giving me a reward. There's no reason to refuse.\n\nAnd the Emperor personally summoned me, I can't just ignore it.\n\nI'll just receive a small reward and come back.\n\nUnlike my lighthearted attitude, Rachel's expression was serious.\n\n\"Young master.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\"\n\n\"Never! Never, never, never!! Make a mistake with the First Princess!\"\n\n\"......Ah.\"\n\nOnly after hearing those words did I realize what Rachel was worried about.\n\nNow that I think about it, there was that incident.\n\nRaiden's crazy career-high performance.\n\nTo shake off Lucy, who was absolutely determined not to give up on him.\n\nHe slapped her in front of the Emperor…\n\n'Damn it.'\n\nHow is this bastard still alive?\n\nNo, he did die, but how was he alive back then?\n\nI sighed with a disgusted expression.\n\n'After doing such insane things, he really cried his eyes out in the underground prison.'\n\nIf I remember correctly, Raiden started self-harming right after this incident.\n\nHe probably couldn't forgive himself for laying a hand on his precious lord.\n\nYeah, it's pitiful.\n\nIt's pitiful, but…\n\n'Didn't you accumulate too much karma?'\n\nAnd I'm even cleaning up your karma.\n\nYou should have lived a cleaner life, for the sake of those who come after you.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[It's your karma.]\n\n[Endure it with evil and grit.]\n\n\"......\"\n\nWhat are you on about?\n\nYou're quiet all the time, why do you only pop up at times like this?\n\nAnd shouldn't you, at least, be on my side?\n\nI poured out my complaints towards the status window inwardly.\n\n\"Young master! Are you listening to me?!\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah… I'll act politely this time, don't worry.\"\n\n\"Ugh… I'm worried…!\"\n\n\"If I end up in prison again, will you come visit me?\"\n\n\"Young master!!!\"\n\nI chuckled softly at Rachel's outburst and organized the letter I was holding.\n\nSpeaking of the Imperial Palace.\n\nIt's been a really long time since Raiden went to the Imperial Palace too.\n\nHe hasn't visited even once since he became a wastrel.\n\nWell… nothing much will happen, right?\n\nI muttered to myself, averting my gaze.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe day after receiving the letter.\n\nI boarded the carriage heading to the Imperial Palace.\n\n-Rumble…\n\nOnly the sound of the wheels turning echoed quietly inside the empty carriage.\n\nIs the high class really different?\n\nThe stability was on a different level compared to the Academy carriage.\n\nThere wasn't even a rattling sound, is this the Imperial family's financial power…?\n\nUnshakable comfort.\n\nThe carriage traveled for several hours without any particular incident.\n\nStill, the spacious passenger seats inevitably gave off a somewhat empty feeling.\n\n\"…Should I have brought Rachel along?\"\n\nI muttered to myself, looking out the window.\n\nWith no one sitting next to me, I felt strangely lonely.\n\n\"Why am I getting sentimental…\"\n\nI chuckled, scoffing at myself, and closed my eyes.\n\nThe raw silence, devoid of any noise, gently seeped into my ears.\n\nAs I savored the stillness for a moment, I saw the carriage passing through a forest path.\n\n\"That's strange…? Was this the road to the Imperial Palace?\"\n\nIs it a shortcut I don't know?\n\nBefore my muttering could echo inside the carriage.\n\n-Clang!!\n\nA loud noise rang out, and the carriage came to a halt.\n\nA booming voice came from inside the shaking carriage.\n\n-Hand over everything inside the carriage!!\n\nFor a moment, I wondered if I had misheard.\n\nThis is the Imperial carriage…?\n\nBandits are attacking…?\n\nFlustered, I opened the carriage door and stepped out, and the coachman came into view, trembling and kneeling on the ground.\n\nI looked at him and said,\n\n\"Coachman, please stay inside the carriage.\"\n\n\"P-pardon…? B-but…\"\n\n\"You'll only get in the way.\"\n\n\"Y-yes, yes! My lord!\"\n\nThe coachman hurriedly scurried into the carriage, making a fuss.\n\nI glanced at him and then turned my gaze to where the voice had come from.\n\nStanding there were strange-looking people who seemed to be screaming, 'I'm a bandit!'\n\n'Their equipment is all daggers or swords… about twenty of them.'\n\nWhile I was visually gauging the enemy's strength.\n\nOne of the bandits shouted.\n\n\"Hey, you there! You look like a rich young master, we will spare your life if you just hand over what's inside the carriage.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nAre these guys morons?\n\nCan't they see the Imperial crest on the carriage?\n\nIf they're caught, their entire families will be annihilated…\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nAs I scanned the carriage with suspicion, I soon discovered something strange.\n\nT/N: You can post comments with an alias by selecting Name/URL in dropdown option\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

What, where did he go…\"\n\nI swung my sword towards his stupid head, which was turning around in a daze.\n\n-Slash!\n\nThe sound of the blade slicing through flesh and bone echoed.\n\nA silver line was drawn in the air, and a red fountain gushed out.\n\n-Thud, thud…\n\nAnd then, his head fell to the ground pathetically.\n\n\"......\"\n\nThe bandits, who had been noisy just a moment ago, fell silent.\n\nI looked at them and stomped on the rolling head.\n\n-Crunch…!\n\nThe face burst with a pleasant sound.\n\nI rubbed the blood and brains splattered on my shoes against the ground and said,\n\n\"Aren't you coming?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Then I'll come to you.\"\n\nI raised my sword and kicked off the ground.\n\nFor a while, the sounds of clashing steel and horrifying screams echoed through the forest.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"Ugh…\"\n\nA forest path splendidly splattered with red bloodstains.\n\nSevered limbs scattered on the ground.\n\nMud soaked with fresh organ fragments.\n\nStanding at the center of this hellish landscape was…\n\n\"Is it over?\"\n\nNone other than myself.\n\nI wiped off the blood dripping from my sword and turned my head.\n\n\"Ugh, uh, aaaah…\"\n\nMy gaze landed on the last surviving bandit, crawling on the ground.\n\nWith both legs severed, he was writhing and screaming.\n\nI slowly approached him.\n\n\"D-don't come closer…!

I will be your guide while you stay at the Imperial Palace.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nThe chief maid of the Imperial Palace, Bella.\n\nI had encountered her several times back when Raiden frequented the palace as if it were his own home.\n\nAfter the incident with Lucy, I never had the chance to see her again.\n\n\"Then, please allow me to guide you.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"This way.\"\n\nBella led the way with a mechanical tone. I began to follow behind her.\n\nStarting with a beautiful garden, we entered the lavishly decorated interior of the palace.\n\nRed and gold threads were intricately intertwined on the white floors and walls, forming the grand crest of the Imperial family.\n\nI was momentarily mesmerized by the dazzling chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.\n\n'Magnificent…'\n\nEven though I inherited Raiden's memories, seeing the palace of this fantasy world with my own eyes was enough to send shivers down my spine.\n\nAs I was looking around, Bella suddenly turned to me and spoke.\n\n\"Before meeting His Majesty, I will make preparations for you to freshen up.\"\n\n\"Huh? Why suddenly freshen up… Ah.\"\n\nBella's words made me realize what state I was in.\n\nMy hair was messy from sleeping in the carriage, my clothes were stained with blood from dealing with the bandits, and there was even a faint scent of blood clinging to me.\n\nIt was definitely inappropriate to enter the audience chamber in this state.\n\nNo matter how much the Emperor favored me, I had to maintain a minimum level of decorum.\n\nI quietly nodded.\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\"Yes, then this way.\"\n\nBella and I moved towards the room I would be staying in.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, while Raiden was freshening up with Bella's help, a secret conversation was taking place in the audience chamber.\n\n\"Oh? Is that so?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe speakers in this secret conversation were two men.\n\nOne was the Emperor of the Empire, Milliam von Lietrolo, and the other was the coachman who had been driving the carriage Raiden was in until just a moment ago.\n\nThe coachman, kneeling respectfully, continued his report step by step.\n\nThe content of the report was what he had learned and felt while observing Raiden throughout the day.\n\n\"And at that time, Young Master Lishite…\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nMilliam stroked his chin as if intrigued by the coachman's story.\n\nHe was not one to show interest in anything other than his children or work, but the words flowing from the coachman's mouth piqued his curiosity.\n\n\"He dealt with about twenty bandits… alone.\"\n\n\"To be precise, he slaughtered twenty-two bandits in 5 minutes and 38 seconds.\"\n\nThe coachman added bluntly to the Emperor's murmur. Milliam stroked his beard, pondering the coachman's answer.\n\n\"I'm certain that until about half a year ago, Young Master Lishite had no talent for martial arts…\"\n\n\"Yes, as I recall, it was so.\"\n\n\"Hmm…\"\n\nMilliam fell silent, seemingly lost in thought.\n\nHe tapped his fingers on the armrest as usual, then posed another question to the coachman.\n\n\"What is Sir Austin's opinion?\"\n\n\"Are you referring to Young Master Lishite?\"\n\nMilliam nodded at the coachman's question.\n\nThen the old coachman, called Sir Austin, with his graying hair, gave a straightforward assessment of Raiden.\n\n\"He's outstanding.\"\n\n\"Oh? Is that so?\"\n\n\"I'm considering recommending him to the Imperial Knights once he's more seasoned.\"\n\n\"To that extent?\"\n\nMilliam's blue eyes were tinged with surprise.\n\nHe hadn't expected such high praise to come from Austin's mouth.\n\nWho was Sir Austin?\n\nHe was the knight-commander of the Imperial Knights, a group composed of only the most talented individuals in the Empire.\n\nHe was a man known as \"Cold Wind\" due to his extremely cold personality.\n\nHe rarely had a good word to say to his knights, yet he was giving unprecedented praise to Young Master Lishite.\n\n\"This is quite surprising, to hear such words from you.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Was there anything else that impressed you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I can't be certain, but... Young Master Lishite seemed to have grasped that the entire situation was a test set by Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Chuckle… I expected that much. He was always a bright child, so he must have noticed.\"\n\nThe Emperor chuckled pleasantly, his eyes gleaming.\n\nHis lips were already curved into a long arc.\n\n\"Hearing your words makes me even more eager to meet Young Master Lishite.\"\n\n\"The young master is currently freshening up.\"\n\n\"Hmm, then… I should make preparations as well.\"\n\nMilliam turned his head and called out to the maids waiting nearby.\n\n\"You there. The young master will be here soon, summon the Crown Prince and the princesses.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe maids moved according to the order.\n\nMilliam watched their retreating figures and murmured to himself,\n\n\"It's been quite a while, Young Master Lishite…\"\n\nMilliam stroked his chin with an unreadable smile.\n\n***\n\n\"Phew… that's better.\"\n\nAfter washing up and changing into fresh clothes, I headed towards the audience chamber once again, guided by Bella.\n\nWith the stench of blood that had clung to me gone, I finally felt like I could breathe properly.\n\nI adjusted my suit as I walked.\n\n\"Damn it… I should have brought Rachel along.\"\n\nThis damn tie is so hard to tie.\n\nI followed Rachel's instructions exactly, but somehow, one or two parts always ended up crooked after I finished tying it.\n\nHow does Rachel tie it so neatly?\n\nIs this the power of a personal maid…?\n\nI muttered to myself as I repeatedly untied and retied the awkwardly tied tie.\n\nAs I was struggling with the tie, Bella, who was walking ahead, turned around.\n\n\"If the tie is bothering you, I can fix it for you.\"\n\n\"Ah… um, no. I'll try to do it myself.\"\n\n\"As you wish.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the offer.\"\n\nI shook my head at Bella's question and continued my battle with the tie.\n\nIt felt awkward to ask someone I'd just met to tie my tie, especially at the age of eighteen.\n\nBesides…\n\n-I-if it's alright with you, young master…\n\n-I-I'll do my best… to tie your tie.\n\nMy tie already has someone responsible for it.\n\nI nodded to myself, thinking nonchalantly.\n\nMy cheeks felt strangely warm, but it must be my imagination.\n\nAs I continued walking, fiddling with the unfortunate tie, Bella, who was leading me, stopped in front of a massive door.\n\nWe had arrived at the audience chamber.\n\n\"His Majesty awaits you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll enter right away.\"\n\nI stopped fidgeting with my hands, straightened my back, and squared my shoulders.\n\nThe guards, who had been watching me, slowly began to push open the closed doors.\n\n-Clank…\n\nThe doors started to open with a heavy sound.\n\nThrough the widening gap, the dazzling interior of the audience chamber came into view.\n\nGolden pillars, a long red carpet stretching across the floor, and at the end of the carpet, a high staircase leading up to a single throne.\n\n\"Phew…\"\n\nI took a deep breath and stepped inside the audience chamber.\n\nThe soft texture of the carpet, even felt through my shoes, eased my tension a little.\n\nI stopped in front of the staircase and bowed my head towards the throne.\n\nThen, I calmly knelt on one knee and bowed in respect.\n\n\"Raiden Lishite, the eldest son of the Lishite family, greets the Sun of the Empire.\"\n\nThe figure who had been silent spoke.\n\n\"Raise your head.\"\n\nA voice with a gentle timbre resonated in my ears.\n\nI raised my head and looked at the sun above.\n\n\"It's been a long time, Young Master Lishite.\"\n\nPlatinum blonde hair as if colored by the summer sun, deep blue eyes like the ocean, a neatly trimmed beard, and an overwhelming charisma.\n\nIt was the Emperor of the Empire, Milliam von Lietrolo.\n\n\"I heard you returned about a month ago… but it's been almost a year since we last met face-to-face.\"\n\n\"I should have come to see you sooner, Your Majesty. I apologize for my negligence. Please punish me for my disloyalty.\"\n\n\"Chuckle… I'm not blaming you. I'm just expressing my joy at seeing you again.\"\n\nMilliam stopped me from bowing my head again and continued.\n\n\"Yes, I heard about how you saved the Star of the Empire. I don't know how to reward you for such a great service.\"\n\n\"I was merely fulfilling my duty as a subject of Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Hmm…\"\n\nI bowed as I spoke, and Milliam let out a small hum as if satisfied with my demeanor.\n\n\"The children aren't here yet… so let's discuss your reward later.\"\n\n\"I understand that the Crown Prince usually resides in the palace… but are the princesses here as well?\"\n\nWhy are they here?\n\nI'm sure I saw them at the Academy just the other day.\n\n\"Of course, I brought them here immediately after the incident. They both arrived yesterday.\"\n\nWell… it's only natural that he wouldn't leave the royal family alone after the Academy was breached.\n\nThey need to be protected within the Imperial Palace, at least until the Academy's security is reinforced.\n\n\"It seems it will take some time for the children to arrive… In the meantime, would you tell me about the attack?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nI calmly began to recount the events of that day.\n\n***\n\nOn the opposite side of the audience chamber was the \"Palace of Stars\".\n\nIt was a place where the Emperor's children, excluding the Crown Prince, usually rested.\n\nLucy, who had returned to the palace after a long time, was spending her time listlessly sitting on a sofa.\n\nUntil Milliam's summons arrived.\n\n\"What? His Majesty has summoned us?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Highness.\"\n\n\"What is it about…?\"\n\nAs Lucy murmured while getting up, the maid who was attending her answered.\n\n\"I heard that Young Master Lishite has visited the palace.\"\n\n\"What…?

His Majesty is waiting.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand.\"\n\nLucy stepped out of the room with heavy steps.\n\nShe walked towards the main palace where the audience chamber was located, accompanied by her maid.\n\nAn inexplicable tremor echoed faintly in her chest.\n\nLucy pressed down on the slight ache in her chest and silently repeated Raiden's name to herself.\n\n\"Raiden…\"\n\nI've thought about you constantly since that day, but…\n\nI still don't understand.\n\nWhat should I do now?\n\nWhat should I say to you, what expression should I make when I see you?\n\nIt's confusing.\n\nYou were the one who broke off our relationship.\n\nUnlike you, who cut me off as if it meant nothing to you, I spent hundreds of nights in tears, trying to erase you from my heart.\n\nBut…\n\nI was gradually getting used to it.\n\nI was finally learning how to live without you.\n\n-Do not worry, Your Highness. Your knight is here.\n\nWhy do you keep appearing in my mind?\n\nWhy do you wear such a sad smile?\n\n'What… what do you want…?'\n\nLucy bit her lip in frustration, overwhelmed by the questions flooding her mind.\n\nLost in thought, she hadn't noticed that she had already reached the door of the audience chamber.\n\n\"We've arrived, Your Highness.\"\n\nThe door of the audience chamber seemed even more massive than usual today.\n\nLucy took a short, deep breath and murmured as if talking to herself,\n\n\"Why am I so nervous…?\"\n\nIt was just a meeting with a bad knight who had forgotten his promise.\n\nShe tried to shake off the negative thoughts and gestured to the guards to open the door.\n\n-Creak…\n\nThe door opened with a heavy sound.\n\nAnd through the widening gap, the figure of a boy came into view.\n\nJet black hair and a matching black suit.\n\nA tall and sturdy physique.\n\nAn air of fatigue seemed to cling to him.\n\nThe boy turned his head and looked towards Lucy.\n\nRaiden Lishite.\n\nThe knight who had once served her as his lord was waiting for her.\n\n***\n\n\"…And so, that's what happened.\"\n\n\"Truly remarkable.\"\n\nMilliam stroked his beard with interest as he listened to my account of the attack on the banquet hall.\n\n\"I can't believe it, even after hearing it so many times. Are you really the same Young Master Lishite who had absolutely no talent for the sword?\"\n\n\"I am still lacking.\"\n\n\"Even your answers are to my liking… It feels like I'm seeing the old you again.\"\n\nThe Emperor chuckled, seemingly very pleased with me.\n\nHis rather unique laughter made me inwardly flustered.\n\nThen, Milliam wiped the smile off his face and looked down at me with a somewhat serious gaze.\n\n\"Yes… I had my suspicions ever since I heard that you effortlessly overcame the 'test' I had set for you, but you exceeded my expectations.\"\n\n\"By test, you mean…\"\n\n\"Are you pretending not to know when you already do? I'm talking about the bandits you encountered on your way here.\"\n\nAh, he's talking about that.\n\nThe surprise gift that our curious Emperor had prepared for me.\n\nI figured it out right away, but it was quite disconcerting.\n\nWhat kind of Emperor would send the eldest son of the closest family to the Imperial family into a dangerous group of bandits?\n\nEven if it was to confirm my skills and verify the rumors, wasn't it a bit too extreme?\n\n\"Chuckle… Don't look at me like that.\"\n\nAs I was sending him a very disloyal glare, Milliam grinned as if he found the situation incredibly amusing.\n\nHis playful tone seemed to be subtly teasing me.\n\n\"That's why I sent the Imperial Knight-Commander as your escort, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Thanks to you, I was able to arrive safely. I am deeply grateful for your grace, Your Majesty.\"\n\nI swallowed the curse that was about to escape my lips and replied.\n\nOf course, I had already guessed that the frail-looking coachman was Sir Austin.\n\nI didn't figure it out from the start, but once I realized that the whole situation was a test set by Milliam, it became clear.\n\n\"Do you have any basis for concluding that the coachman was Sir Austin?\"\n\n\"Of course. Your Majesty has a compulsion to carry out all tasks perfectly. Therefore, I believe you would have given your best even in this small test.\"\n\nA test that involves putting the eldest son of a Duke's family in danger.\n\nThis is a matter that could easily lead to a major incident.\n\nWhether I was injured or not, the Lishite family could have filed a complaint.\n\nIt could have escalated into a conflict between the Imperial family and our house.\n\nHowever, it's a different story if a Knight-Commander is involved.\n\nThe moment they are assigned as an escort, discussing the risk of an accident becomes a joke.\n\nThey are geniuses who are considered the best fighting force in the Empire.\n\nSince you assigned 'Winter Commander' Austin, the pinnacle of the Imperial Knights, as my escort, the Lishite family wouldn't be able to say anything even if they wanted to.\n\nMoreover, it would give other families the impression that the relationship between the Imperial family and the Lishite family is very close.\n\nIt's like declaring, 'We're so close that we even share the Imperial Knight-Commander, the most valuable asset of the Imperial family!'\n\nIf this news spreads, the authority of the Imperial family will be further solidified.\n\nThe Lishite Dukedom is undeniably one of the most prestigious families on the continent.\n\nWell, the rest is simple.\n\nThe coachman's identity was narrowed down to a Knight-Commander.\n\nAnd as far as I know, there is no other Commander with such a frail appearance besides Austin.\n\nThe other Commanders are all muscular and imposing.\n\n\"…That is all.\"\n\n\"Chuckle… You're still as sharp as ever.\"\n\n\"You flatter me.\"\n\nI clicked my tongue inwardly.\n\nTo think that he would consider even the smallest details for their political impact…\n\nHe's a formidable person.\n\nAs expected of the owner of the greatest intellect, as acknowledged by the author.\n\nIf only Milliam hadn't become a recluse in the original story…\n\nIt was said that he could have prevented over 60% of the schemes of the demons and the Seekers.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how things will unfold from now on.\n\n-Creak…\n\nAs Milliam and I were having this conversation, the door to the audience chamber opened and someone entered.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Considering all members corroborated the same story, I believe it's safe to assume its veracity.\"\n\nOf course, that was a blatant lie.\n\nThe only conversations I had with those guys were along the lines of, 'I'm going to kill you.'\n\nThe only reason I knew the Cult was the mastermind was because of my knowledge of the original story.\n\nSince it's a fact that the Cult is the mastermind, it shouldn't matter, right?\n\nAfter all, if you mix one truth with one lie, you get two truths.\n\n\"It's not an easy story to believe… but if what you say is true, the age of adventure will soon be upon us.\"\n\n= If what you say is true, a bloodbath will soon engulf the Empire.\n\nMilliam muttered, his eyes narrowing.\n\nEven the slight narrowing of his eyelids exuded an inexplicable charisma.\n\n\"However, Your Majesty… even with the Young Master Lishite's assurance, there's no evidence, is there?\"\n\n\"Exactly, Father! How can you believe such an absurd claim?!\"\n\n\"Neria, show some respect to His Majesty.\"\n\n\"But it's true! Brother, you think the same, don't you?!\"\n\nSeon and Neria still seemed unconvinced.\n\nMilliam nodded as if acknowledging the validity of their concerns.\n\n\"It's an intriguing topic, but… your words lack any concrete basis.\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, there's no one but you to corroborate the claim that you extracted this information through interrogation.\"\n\n\"That is also correct.\"\n\nAs Milliam pointed out, my argument was not flawless.\n\nIt would be difficult to prove conclusively that the Cult was the mastermind.\n\nBut this was enough.\n\nMy goal was simply to grab their attention.\n\nThis much was enough to heighten Milliam's vigilance and suspicion towards the Cult.\n\n'I'd consider this… a success.'\n\nI had piqued Milliam's interest and drawn him into the game.\n\nFrom now on, the Cult would have a hard time trying to outsmart the world's greatest intellect.\n\nTheir activities would naturally be hampered.\n\n\"It's a bit audacious of you to try and manipulate me like a chess piece, but the story is intriguing enough for me to let it slide.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n…Damn, he saw right through me.\n\nA shiver ran down my spine.\n\nMilliam waved his hand dismissively as if telling me to relax.\n\n\"No need to be tense. Consider it a compliment.\"\n\n\"I am honored.\"\n\n\"By the way… you seem quite invested in this matter. The way you're approaching it so proactively.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that be natural?\"\n\nI met Milliam's gaze directly.\n\nThe Seekers, and the Cult…\n\n\"They are my mother's enemies.\"\n\nMilliam was momentarily taken aback by my calm tone.\n\nHe coughed awkwardly as if realizing he had touched a sensitive subject.\n\n\"Ahem… I apologize for my insensitive remark.\"\n\n\"It's alright.\"\n\n\"I will keep your words in mind.\"\n\n\"I am grateful.\"\n\nMilliam chuckled at my curt response.\n\n\"You've changed so much… I heard you've even stopped your awkward delinquent act.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is correct.\"\n\n\"How does it feel? To shed that mask?\"\n\n\"It… wasn't as refreshing as I thought it would be. I lost too much in the process.\"\n\nI said, glancing at Lucy and Neria standing a short distance away.\n\nThey had been lost in thought since the middle of my conversation with Milliam.\n\nNeria frowned when our eyes met, while Lucy averted her gaze and turned her head away.\n\nI gestured towards them with a slight shrug.\n\nMilliam smiled wryly.\n\n\"Please take care of them… They're good children, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Do you know how much Lucy grieved when you suddenly disappeared?\"\n\n\"Huh...?\"\n\nI was taken aback by his unexpected words.\n\nMilliam chuckled.\n\n\"It was a mess… She shut herself in her room, refused to eat, and cried for days…\"\n\n\"Yo-Your Majesty…!\"\n\nLucy quickly intervened to stop the embarrassing revelation.\n\nHer cheeks were flushed crimson.\n\nI couldn't help but feel a surge of confusion.\n\nIt had only been about half a year since Raiden's disappearance.\n\nDid that mean she still cared about Raiden until recently?\n\nSurely, Milliam was just teasing… right?\n\nAs I was drowning in a sea of doubt, Milliam smoothly steered the conversation back on track.\n\n“Well, we can talk about that later… We've strayed quite a bit from the original topic. We were discussing your reward.”\n\nThe Emperor stroked his beard as if in thought.\n\n\"What is it that you desire? I doubt there's anything the eldest son of a Duke's family would lack… but tell me nonetheless.\"\n\n\"I have something in mind.\"\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Are you referring to Emotion-Soothing Tobacco?\"\n\nMilliam seemed surprised by my unexpected request.\n\nHis reaction was understandable.\n\nDeathweed was a potent tranquilizer.\n\nDeathweed (死滅草).\n\nAlso known as Emotion-Soothing Tobacco.\n\nAs the name suggests, it was a blend of various herbs compressed into a cigarette-like stick.\n\nInhaling the smoke had the effect of alleviating negative mental states.\n\nDue to this effect, it was used by retired soldiers and patients suffering from mental illnesses, but it had fallen out of use due to severe side effects such as hallucinations and auditory illusions.\n\nSimply put, it was essentially medical-grade marijuana.\n\n\"Deathweed…\"\n\nMilliam frowned, then gave me a pitiful look.\n\n\"It seems your mind is still not fully recovered.\"\n\n\"I apologize.\"\n\n\"…How do you intend to deal with the side effects?\"\n\n\"I have a way.\"\n\nThe side effects of Deathweed were hallucinations and auditory illusions.\n\nThey were so potent that most people couldn't withstand them.\n\nThat was why ordinary people wouldn't dare touch Deathweed.\n\nBut I had 'Iron Will.'\n\nIt meant I could negate the side effects caused by mere drugs.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure you'll find a way. You have my permission.\"\n\n\"I am honored.\"\n\n\"However, you are the only one who should use it. You are not allowed to distribute the imported Deathweed within the Empire.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nWith this, I could now deal with the panic states that 'Iron Will' couldn't handle.\n\nAs I lowered my head with a satisfied smile, Milliam concluded the meeting.\n\n\"It's getting quite late.

Magnificent, isn't it?\"\n\nMilliam, who was walking ahead, looked back at me and asked.\n\nI was silently taking in the night scenery.\n\n\"Indeed, it is.\"\n\n\"Chuckle… It's one of the prides of this palace!\"\n\nMilliam laughed heartily at my response and stopped in the middle of the garden.\n\nI also stopped a few steps behind him.\n\n-Swoosh…\n\nThe bushes swayed in unison with the wind.\n\nFlower petals danced in the breeze, releasing their sweet fragrance.\n\nMilliam stood tall amidst the early autumn scents, enjoying the tranquility.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Milliam suddenly asked,\n\n\"Do you know something?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"I… don't particularly like the sun.\"\n\n\"Huh...?\"\n\nAs I was taken aback by his sudden statement, Milliam chuckled and continued,\n\n\"It's not that I have any hidden meaning or anything. I mean it literally.\"\n\n\"But… why would the Sun of the Empire say such a thing…?\"\n\n\"Ha ha, is it strange?\"\n\nMilliam let out his characteristic laughter a few more times, then pointed his index finger at the night sky.\n\n\"You see… the sun is too bright.\"\n\n\"How can you call that a flaw?\"\n\n\"A shining sun… it swallows everything around it with its brilliant radiance. The light of the stars in the sky, the cool night air, the peaceful silence, everything.\"\n\nMilliam gazed at the moon in the night sky with a wistful expression.\n\nI remained silent, not wanting to disturb his contemplation.\n\n\"The sun is destined to live alone.\"\n\nBut the moon was different.\n\nIts gentle moonlight coexisted with countless stars.\n\nMilliam lowered his gaze and looked at me.\n\n\"I wanted to be like the moon… because people can't live alone.\"\n\nThere was a time when I admired the uniqueness of the sun.\n\nBut after ascending to the position of the sun, I realized that even if I became a lofty and solitary light, I would only disappear beyond the horizon alone when evening came.\n\n\"People are like a night sky… They need people to live with and a certain amount of darkness around them.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nHe was clearly talking to me, but it felt more like a soliloquy.\n\nThe Sun's lament, filled with bitterness and regret, echoed softly in the tranquil atmosphere.\n\n'Come to think of it, Milliam… was said to have been a lonely person who lived in his own world.'\n\nAfter the Empress, his only love, passed away at an early age…\n\nHe changed his ways according to her last wishes and started to care for those around him…\n\nRecalling those stories, the air surrounding Milliam seemed particularly lonely.\n\nMilliam smiled enigmatically and said,\n\n\"Take good care of those around you… You need to fix all the things you've messed up.\"\n\nBecause if you wait any longer, it might be too late.\n\nWith those parting words, Milliam chuckled to himself and resumed walking.\n\n\"I guess I can't hide my age… I've become a rambling old man.\"\n\n\"You are still in good spirits, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Chuckle… I'll be heading back now. See you tomorrow.\"\n\nAfter a simple farewell, Milliam left with Sir Austin, who had been silently following us.\n\nI stood under the night sky where the sun had disappeared.\n\nI was quietly replaying our conversation in my mind.\n\n\"People can't live alone, huh…\"\n\nI couldn't quite grasp the meaning of those words, having spent most of my previous life alone.\n\nBut somehow, I felt that he was right.\n\n\"......\"\n\nI was left alone in the starlit garden.\n\nThe cool night air urged me to delve deeper into my thoughts.\n\nJust as my sinking heart was about to reach the bottom of the abyss…\n\n\"Huff… Huff… Raiden…!\"\n\nSomeone called out from behind me again.\n\nIt was a familiar voice.\n\nA graceful yet delicate voice.\n\nThe only difference was that it was laced with heavy breaths.\n\nSurprised, I turned around to see who it was.\n\n\"......\"\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was beautiful, flowing platinum blonde hair.\n\nMystical, shimmering blue eyes.\n\nAnd pale, white skin that seemed even more ethereal under the moonlight.\n\nI took in the picturesque scene before me and spoke the girl's name.\n\n\"Your Highness…?\"\n\n\"Huff… Huff…\"\n\nIt was Lucy.\n\nShe was approaching me with heavy breaths, her steps hurried.\n\nHer clothes were wrinkled in places, as if she had been running.\n\n\"Your Highness, what brings you here at this hour?\"\n\nI asked, flustered by her sudden appearance. Lucy frowned and glared at me.\n\nHer clear blue eyes reflected my image like a mirror.\n\nI flinched and took a step back as our eyes met.\n\nThose blue eyes reminded me of the fear and wariness I had seen in her at the carriage station.\n\n\"Raiden…\"\n\nHer expression contorted at my reaction.\n\nOr rather, it crumpled into a look of distress.\n\nI stood there frozen, unsure of what to do, wondering what had gotten into her.\n\n\"Your Highness…?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nLucy didn't respond to my call.\n\nShe simply stared at me, catching her unsteady breath.\n\nShe was trembling.\n\nHer lips twitched slightly.\n\nHer eyes, filled with a mixture of emotions, were fixed on me.\n\nThere were even faint tear stains on her cheeks.\n\n-Tap…\n\nLucy, who had been staring intently at me, began to walk towards me, one step at a time.\n\nHer voice, laced with an unknown emotion, trembled as she murmured,\n\n\"Raiden… You… You…\"\n\n\"Huh...?\"\n\nShe was muttering something I couldn't understand.\n\nLucy stopped right in front of me and clenched her fists. Then…\n\n\"You… You…\"\n\n\"Your Highness…? What's wrong…?\"\n\n\"You idiot…!\"\n\n\"Oof…?!\"\n\nShe lunged at me, headbutting me in the chest.\n\nWhat the…\n\nWhat was that all about?\n\nI fell back as Lucy collided with me, thinking to myself.\n\n***\n\nA few hours earlier.\n\nAfter the conversation in the audience chamber.\n\nLucy was sitting on her bed in her room.\n\nUnlike her body, which was resting comfortably, her mind was a battlefield.\n\nShe held her throbbing forehead and muttered to herself,\n\n\"What… what did that mean…?\"\n\nThe conversation between Milliam and Raiden kept replaying in her head.\n\n-Wouldn't that be natural? … The Seekers, and the Cult… They are my mother's enemies.\n\n-You've changed so much… I heard you've even stopped your awkward delinquent act.\n\n-Yes, that is correct.\n\n-How does it feel? To shed that mask?\n\n-…It wasn't as refreshing as I thought it would be. I lost too much in the process.\n\nLucy frowned at their cryptic conversation.\n\nIt sounded like there was a backstory she didn't know about.\n\nAnd the fact that Raiden's condition was so bad that he needed to take the infamous Deathweed was something she had never heard of.\n\nOnly a handful of people within the Imperial family knew about Lady Lishite's tragedy.\n\nNaturally, Lucy, who was unaware of Raiden's story, could only ponder the mystery.\n\n\"Ugh…!\"\n\nUnable to bear the turmoil in her heart, Lucy abruptly got up from the bed.\n\nShe stepped onto the floor and murmured,\n\n\"I should ask my brother… He seemed to know something.\"\n\nRecalling Seon's ambiguous gaze towards Raiden, Lucy left her room.\n\nShe headed straight for the Crown Prince's chambers.\n\n-Knock, knock, knock…\n\n\"Brother…? Are you free right now…?\"\n\n-Lucy? What brings you here at this hour…? Ah, come in.\n\nSeon was surprised by his younger sister's sudden visit, but he welcomed her warmly.\n\nHis desk was cluttered with documents as if he had been in the middle of work.\n\nLucy felt a pang of guilt, wondering if she was interrupting him, but she stepped inside nonetheless.\n\n\"So… what brings you here at this late hour, Your Highness?\"\n\n\"…I have something to ask.\"\n\n\"It must be urgent if you came all the way here… What is it?\"\n\n\"Well… back in the audience chamber…\"\n\nLucy began to lay out the questions that had been swirling in her mind.\n\nSeon listened to his sister's story in silence.\n\nAt first glance, he seemed relaxed, but the fact that he had stopped moving his pen betrayed his inner turmoil.\n\n\"…So I was wondering if there was something I didn't know…\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"I thought maybe you would know…\"\n\nLucy fidgeted with her fingers as if gauging his reaction.\n\nSeon rolled his eyes for a moment, then let out a deep sigh.\n\n\"Ha… I knew this day would come.\"\n\n\"Brother, you do know something, don't you…?\"\n\n\"I do, but I'm not sure if it's right for you to hear it from me…\"\n\n\"Please… tell me, brother.\"\n\nLucy looked at Seon with pleading eyes.\n\nSeon remained silent, as if contemplating, then scratched the back of his head.\n\n\"…Well, the fact that Father and Young Master Lishite brought up the topic means… it's alright for you to know about it too.\"\n\n\"So…?\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll tell you. About the 'tragedy' that befell the Lishite family, which has been kept strictly confidential.\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"Huff… Huff…\"\n\nLucy ran.\n\nImmediately after hearing Seon's story, she bolted out of the room.\n\nShe ran through the palace, frantically searching.\n\n-Your Highness…?! Where are you going at this late hour…?\n\n-Your Highness…?\n\nShe heard the voices of maids along the way, but she ignored them and kept running.\n\nOnly one name occupied Lucy's mind.\n\n-Lucy… We owe him a great debt.\n\n-In a way, Young Master Lishite was sacrificed for the well-being of the Imperial family…\n\n-I can't even begin to imagine how he must have felt pushing away those he cared about.\n\nRaiden Lishite.\n\nThe boy she had resented so much.\n\nThe foolish friend who tried to shoulder everything alone.\n\nAnd… the loyal knight who had never betrayed her.\n\nShe had to see him.\n\n\"Raiden…!\"\n\nLucy ran to Raiden's room, but he wasn't there.\n\nShe bit her lip in frustration.\n\n'No…'\n\nHe can't disappear.\n\nI just found out the truth.\n\nI finally understand your sorrow, your pain, your loneliness.\n\nShe wiped her teary eyes and continued searching for him.\n\nAfter some time…\n\nLucy finally found Raiden in the garden behind the palace.\n\nHe was blending in with the darkened bushes.\n\nHis jet black hair, swaying in the wind, framed his blue eyes.\n\n\"Huff… Huff… Raiden…!\"\n\n\"Your Highness…?\"\n\nThe boy turned around at her call.\n\nLucy caught her breath as she approached him.\n\n\"Your Highness, what brings you here at this hour?\"\n\nRaiden asked calmly.\n\nLucy frowned.\n\nShe was angry.\n\nHow could he look so at ease?\n\nWhen he was suffering so much inside.\n\nWhy was he pretending to be fine?\n\nA wave of unknown anger and resentment welled up inside her.\n\n\"......\"\n\nBut those feelings were washed away by his reaction.\n\nRaiden flinched and took a step back when their eyes met.\n\nLucy felt her heart clench.\n\n\"Raiden…\"\n\nHer lips trembled, and her chest tightened.\n\nHis vulnerable appearance seemed so sad and pitiful to her now that she knew everything.\n\nWith blurred vision, she walked towards him.\n\nWhat should she say?\n\nThere were so many things she wanted to say.\n\nBut all that came out were incoherent murmurs.\n\n\"Raiden… You… You…\"\n\nCountless sentences formed and dissolved in her mouth.\n\nThe words in her mind clashed, connected, shattered, and separated again.\n\nIn the end, she couldn't say anything.\n\nShe could only…\n\n\"You idiot…!\"\n\n…burst into tears and threw herself at him.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Do you still… think that way…?\"\n\n\"I'm much better now.\"\n\n\"That means… you're not completely healed.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nSilence fell once more.\n\nTheir conversation kept getting cut short, punctuated by pauses.\n\nLucy needed time to collect herself whenever her emotions surged.\n\n\"Why… didn't you tell me…?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Was I… not trustworthy…? Was I not… a source of support for you…?\"\n\n\"That's not true.\"\n\nRaiden couldn't bear to hear her blame herself any longer.\n\nHe felt a heavy weight pressing down on his chest, a mix of complex emotions. He rubbed his face with his hands.\n\nThen, burying his face in his palms, he spoke,\n\n\"I was… afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid…?\"\n\n\"I felt like all the misfortunes… were happening because of me… I felt like I was going crazy.\"\n\nBecause I was afraid that my existence… would hurt you.\n\nRaiden murmured, his voice trembling in a way that was unusual for him.\n\nSeeing him on the verge of breaking, Lucy felt tears welling up in her eyes again.\n\n\"You idiot… Raiden, you're an idiot…\"\n\n\"Yes… I truly am.\"\n\n\"I… I resented you without knowing anything…\"\n\nHer blue eyes, glistening with unshed tears, resembled the stars in the night sky.\n\nThe stars shimmered, gazing at the boy shrouded in darkness.\n\n\"I'm sorry… I'm sorry, Raiden… I didn't know your pain… If I had known… If only I had known…\"\n\nLucy apologized her face a picture of despair.\n\nHer apology only made Raiden's heart ache more.\n\nHe didn't reply. He simply reached out and wiped away her tears.\n\nThen, with a gentle touch, he caressed her cheek.\n\nHe was remembering.\n\nThe sin he had committed in his moment of despair.\n\nThe cruel handprint he had left on this delicate skin.\n\n\"......\"\n\nHe was silently asking her.\n\nDid it hurt a lot?\n\nAt Raiden's question, filled with guilt and sorrow, Lucy finally broke down, releasing the emotions she had been holding back.\n\n\"Sob… Sob… Waaaah!!\"\n\nSeveral scenes flashed through her mind.\n\nThe first one that came to mind was from around this time last year.\n\nHis cold hand slapped her cheek at her birthday banquet.\n\nThe second was from a few days ago.\n\nHis gentle hand wiping the blood off her cheek after saving her from the assassins.\n\nAnd the last one was right now.\n\nHis longed-for touch, gently comforting her as she cried.\n\n\"Hic…!

His Majesty is waiting.\"\n\n\"I apologize for making you wait every time.\"\n\n\"This way, please.\"\n\nI followed Bella.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"You've arrived.\"\n\n\"Did you rest well last night, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Thanks to you, I did... Hehe.\"\n\nAs I entered the audience chamber, Milliam greeted me with his characteristic chuckle.\n\nI knelt on one knee, offering a light bow.\n\nAs expected, Seon, Lucy, and Neria were standing side by side.\n\nI could understand the princesses being there, but for the Crown Prince to be here to see me off, despite his busy schedule…\n\nI was touched.\n\n\"Thanks to the grace of the Imperial family, I was able to rest comfortably. I wish to return to the Academy now.\"\n\n\"Leaving in such a hurry… It's a shame. I thought I finally had someone to talk to.\"\n\n\"I apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\n\"How many times are you going to apologize?\"\n\nMilliam teased me with a playful smile.\n\nHe glanced at Lucy, who had a bright expression on her face, then smiled warmly.\n\n\"I'm glad everything worked out well.\"\n\n\"It's all thanks to Your Majesty's grace.\"\n\n\"Heh heh… You did well, just as I said. It's good to see.\"\n\n\"…?\"\n\nWhat did he mean by 'just as I said'?\n\nAs I tilted my head in confusion at Milliam's cryptic words, a few snippets of our conversation from last night flashed through my mind.\n\n-Take good care of those around you…\n\n-You need to fix everything you've messed up…\n\n-If it's too late, it might become irreversible…\n\nA possibility dawned on me.\n\n\"…Did you know everything…?\"\n\n\"Heh heh… Well, I did orchestrate the situation where Seon would tell Lucy about you.\"\n\nMilliam shrugged with a sly grin.\n\nI frowned.\n\nHe deliberately allowed my sensitive family matters to be spread…\n\n\"I'm the Emperor. Who's going to question me?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"You're not going to growl at me just because I let slip a 'little' private story, are you?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nAt Milliam's subtly infuriating tone, I lowered my head and muttered,\n\n\"I am simply in awe of Your Majesty's arrangements.\"\n\n\"Heh heh… If you're so upset, why don't you become Emperor yourself?\"\n\nSeriously, that's a very dangerous thing to say.\n\nEven if it's a joke.\n\nHow could he say that in front of the Crown Prince, who will inherit the throne?\n\nI clenched my jaw, suppressing my frustration at Milliam's childish jab.\n\nHe seemed to find my reaction amusing and continued to tease me for a while longer.\n\nAfter some time, I was finally able to excuse myself.\n\n\"Well… as much as I hate to say it, it's time for me to leave.\"\n\n\"Parting only makes the next meeting more meaningful, wouldn't you say?\"\n\n\"You seem strangely happy about it?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Heh heh… Just kidding. Anyway, safe travels, Young Master.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I wish you good health until we meet again.\"\n\n\"So you're saying I shouldn't be healthy after that?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Heh heh… Like I said before, if you're so upset, why don't you become Emperor yourself?\"\n\nBattered by his nonsensical humor punches until the very end, I left the audience chamber, feeling utterly defeated.\n\nFinally, it was time to leave the Imperial Palace for good.\n\nAs I was about to head towards the carriage…\n\n\"Wait, Raiden…!\"\n\nLucy, who had followed me out of the audience chamber, called out to me.\n\n***\n\n\"Then, farewell.\"\n\nRaiden offered a courteous farewell and stepped out of the audience chamber.\n\nLucy, who had been lost in her anxiety, snapped out of it and hurried after him.\n\n\"Wait, Raiden…!\"\n\nHer voice trembled with nervousness.\n\nThe youthful tremor rode the wind, reaching out to grasp Raiden's sleeve.\n\n\"…Your Highness? Is something the matter?\"\n\nRaiden turned his head slightly, his obsidian eyes gazing at the girl.\n\nMeeting his eyes, Lucy flinched and blushed.\n\nThe events of last night in the moonlit garden flashed through her mind.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, she had shamelessly cried in another person's arms.\n\nIt was enough to make her feel a deep sense of shame, especially considering her usual composed and mature demeanor as the Empire's star.\n\nThe backlash was even stronger.\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Your Highness…?\"\n\n\"Ugh…\"\n\nLucy groaned softly and took a deep breath.\n\nOnce she had calmed her racing heart, she slowly spoke.\n\n\"Th-thank you…\"\n\n\"Pardon…? What do you mean all of a sudden?\"\n\nRaiden feigned ignorance, his voice flat.\n\nLucy fidgeted with her fingers, struggling to continue.\n\n\"For… For the other day, the assassination attempt…\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\n\"…I don't think I properly thanked you…\"\n\nAs she added those words, Raiden's blank expression shifted into something more complex.\n\nIt was a smile that held a mixture of surprise, relief, and sadness.\n\nLucy couldn't quite decipher the meaning behind those emotions, but one thing was clear.\n\nHe was genuinely happy.\n\nShe smiled brightly at the boy, whose face held a hint of nostalgia.\n\nHis current image overlapped with the phantom of her childhood friend from long ago.\n\nHe hasn't changed after all.\n\nThe you from that precious time remains the same.\n\nShe murmured to herself and let out a chuckle.\n\n\"Pfft…\"\n\n\"…?\"\n\n\"It's nothing. Just a happy thought.\"\n\nLucy lowered her head, avoiding the boy's questioning gaze.\n\nThen, as if it were truly her last chance, she thanked him once more.\n\nThis time, with a playful bow\n\n\"Thank you for saving me.\"\n\nIt was reminiscent of the past.\n\nThe day the boy and girl had promised a playful master-servant relationship.\n\n\"My knight.\"\n\nAt some point, tiny dewdrops had formed in the corners of her blue eyes.\n\nThe tears, shimmering under the golden sunlight, were a single bloom of joy offered to her valiant knight.\n\nThe boy, who had been lost in thought, finally accepted the flower of emotion presented to him, replying,\n\n\"I only did what was natural.\"\n\nPerhaps both the boy and the girl had deeply yearned for this return of their ill-fated connection.\n\nThey carefully untied the knot that had become tangled and messy.\n\n\"My liege.\"\n\nThe gentle autumn breeze swept past them, a refreshing caress.\n\nAmidst the fluttering black and blonde hair, the girl held the boy's image in her eyes, her breath catching in her throat.\n\n-Thump…\n\nHer heart beat faintly.\n\nShe didn't seem to realize it, but a single strand of affection for the boy was blossoming deep within her delicate heart.\n\nAs she wondered at her racing heart…\n\n\"Then… I'll be going now.\"\n\n\"Yes…! See you at the Academy.\"\n\nThe boy turned away with a calm voice.\n\nThe girl waved goodbye.\n\nThe liege watched the retreating figure of her knight and smiled once more.\n\nThe knot of their ill fate had been untied.\n\nNow, a new kind of knot was tied between their fingers.\n\nA precious connection called 'fateful encounter.'\n\nThe girl quietly walked away, feeling the thread of fate that bound her to the boy.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I'll be off to class.\"\n\n\"Yes, Young Master!\"\n\nI adjusted my tie, which Rachel was straightening, and bid her farewell as I left the dormitory.\n\nAs I opened the door, a cool breeze enveloped me.\n\nAutumn, which had entered November, carried a gentle chill.\n\nI shivered slightly and stepped outside.\n\nThe blue sky, with a few scattered clouds, boasted beautiful colors.\n\nUnconsciously, I fell into thought as I walked.\n\nThe banquet hall attack and the Imperial Palace visit.\n\nIt had already been a month since those two events.\n\nI had been living a peaceful daily life in the midst of the swiftly passing time.\n\nNo other incidents had occurred, and the quests in my status window had been quiet.\n\nOf course, there was a lot of commotion with the attempted assassination of the Princesses and the Saintess and the return of the Seekers...\n\nBut that was Allen's problem to deal with.\n\n\"Ugh...!\"\n\nI stretched with a long exhale.\n\nIt had been about two months and fifteen days since I possessed Raiden's body.\n\nI finally felt like I could breathe.\n\nI rummaged through the front pocket of my coat and pulled something out.\n\nIt was a small box that resembled a cigarette case.\n\nInside were thin sticks that emitted a green light.\n\nIt was the 'Deathweed' that Milliam had sent me in a large carriage some time ago.\n\nI stared at them for a moment before picking one up and putting it in my mouth.\n\nThen, I took out my magic lighter and lit the end of the stick.\n\n-Click, sizzle...\n\nThin smoke rose as the lighter set the stick ablaze.\n\n\"Haa...\"\n\nAs I inhaled, the herbal scent of the death weed seeped into my lungs.\n\nRefreshing scents, like those you'd find in a forest, wafted through my nose.\n\n\"Haa...\"\n\nWhite clouds of smoke escaped my mouth and drifted into the air.\n\nAt the same time, my head cleared, and the gloom that had been weighing down my heart began to wash away.\n\n\"...This is really good.\"\n\nMy mind, which had been troubled by the dream, felt refreshed in an instant.\n\nIt was clear that this world's tranquilizer was several steps ahead of the modern one.\n\nOr maybe it was something else entirely.\n\nAs I stared blankly at the dissipating smoke, a familiar mechanical sound suddenly rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You are experiencing 'Status Effect (Hallucination, Auditory Hallucination)' due to the side effects of consuming 'Death Weed'.]\n\n[Skill 'Iron Will' negates Status Effect (Hallucination, Auditory Hallucination).]\n\n'Iron Will' as always.\n\nDefinitely effective.\n\nWell, it even negates the side effects of the special skill of Sorrow.\n\nThis much is nothing.\n\nFeeling a little better, I smiled and continued to exhale the smoke.\n\nAt that moment...\n\n\"Brother!\"\n\n\"Raiden!\"\n\nI heard two familiar voices from behind.\n\nI turned my head slightly and looked in that direction.\n\n\"Ariel and... Your Highness.\"\n\nAs I waved my hand lightly, Ariel came bouncing towards me and threw her arms around me.\n\n\"Good morning!\"\n\n\"Yes, good morning.\"\n\nAriel, clinging tightly to me, purred and melted as I stroked her hair.\n\nAs I was poking and prodding her squishy cheeks, Lucy, who had followed behind, greeted me with a light bow.\n\n\"Good morning, Raiden.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Your Highness. I trust you slept well?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nAfter a brief exchange of greetings, we started walking together.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change in my life over the past month.\n\nIt would probably be Lucy's presence.\n\nAfter what happened at the Imperial Palace.\n\nThe relationship between Lucy and Raiden began to return to what it once was.\n\nThanks to that, a new color has been added to the realm of my life, which was once filled only with brown and red.\n\nWell, as I spent more time with Lucy, I naturally got caught up with her followers more often.\n\nBut I haven't had much chance to get close to them.\n\nThey weren't exactly on good terms with me in the first place.\n\nIt was still awkward between us.\n\nAs I was chewing on such idle thoughts.\n\nLucy, who was walking beside me, suddenly clapped her hands as if she had remembered something.\n\n\"Ah, right!

Have you checked the group arrangements?\"\n\n\"......Excuse me?\"\n\nSchool trip?\n\nWhat is she talking about...?\n\nAs I tilted my head at the unfamiliar story, Lucy asked me with a slightly surprised look.\n\n\"Don't tell me, you didn't know about the school trip...?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes...\"\n\nCome to think of it, I think there was a school trip event in the original story.\n\nBut that was after Allen became a second year... so around next year?\n\nWait a minute.\n\nSince it's originally for second-year students, Lucy and I are supposed to go this year...?\n\nI asked, realizing it belatedly.\n\n\"Do you happen to know when it is?\"\n\n\"Three days from now.\"\n\n\"......It's really just around the corner.\"\n\n\"You really didn't know...\"\n\nI pressed my forehead at the slight headache that was building.\n\nWhy didn't I know about this?\n\nI'm sure it was mentioned a few times during class. Was that when it was?\n\nI let out a soft sigh and took another drag from the death weed in my mouth.\n\n\"By the way, what do you mean by group arrangements?\"\n\n\"We're divided into groups for activities during the school trip. Don't you think it'll be fun? It's completely random, so it's a bit of a shame...\"\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nGroup activities.\n\nIt sounds uncomfortable just hearing about it.\n\nI held back from saying such a thing and just groaned.\n\n\"Did you check, Your Highness?\"\n\n\"Huh? Of course, I did. I checked as soon as it came out last night.\"\n\n\"I assume we're not in the same group... obviously, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah...

Violet\n\nUnfortunately.\n\nIt was real.\n\n\"Ha...\"\n\nI rubbed the space between my brows with a deep sigh.\n\nIs this for real?\n\nHow can they pair me with my ex-fiancé?\n\nEven if it's random, this is too much.\n\nShouldn't the professors change it manually if such a dangerous group comes out?\n\nAs I was feeling dizzy with those thoughts, Lucy and Ariel, who were checking the group list next to me, also looked flustered.\n\n\"Uh, uh... Why is the group formation like this...?\"\n\n\"There are almost a thousand second-year students, how could such a combination be born...\"\n\nAriel and Lucy each echoed my sentiment.\n\n\"Is it, is it impossible to change groups?\"\n\n\"Uh... Probably. I asked if I could be in the same group as Raiden, but they flatly refused.\"\n\n\"If even Your Highness was rejected, then it's just not possible...\"\n\nAfter exchanging a few words like that, the two of them...\n\nTheir faces darkened as they patted me on the back.\n\n\"Brother, will you be okay...?\"\n\n\"That... Raiden? I'll visit your group often...\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nThey offered their condolences as they looked at my stiff figure.\n\nBut nothing was registering in my ears.\n\nDoes this even make sense?\n\nThere are almost a thousand students!\n\nHow could I be in the same group as Margaret, of all people?\n\nIt wouldn't be strange even if someone rigged it.\n\nWith a complicated mind, I rubbed my face with my hands and muttered to myself.\n\n\"...What a shitty group formation.\"\n\n\"Shitty, you say?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's really shitty... Huh?\"\n\nWait, that's not Lucy's voice.\n\nI was absentmindedly agreeing to the voice behind me.\n\nThe moment I realized that the owner of the voice was not Lucy, I turned around in surprise.\n\nAnd there, dramatically enough......\n\n\"It's shitty, you say?\"\n\nMargaret was standing there, her red eyes glowing coldly.\n\n\"......\"\n\nHer neat uniform was not out of place one bit.\n\nHer curvaceous figure was visible beyond the uniform.\n\nHer silver hair fluttered beautifully in the wind.\n\nAnd her crimson eyes, a mesmerizing color, were staring at me fiercely.\n\nI stared at the sudden appearance of Margaret with wide eyes, and I couldn't help but rub the space between my brows once again.\n\n'No, this is ridiculous...'\n\nIt seemed that the world was really against me.\n\n***\n\n\"Well then, I'll be on my way.\"\n\n\"Have a good day, Miss.\"\n\nMargaret gave a light greeting to her personal maid and left the dormitory.\n\nThe blowing wind ruffled her silver hair.\n\nShe gently brushed her hair back and looked up at the sky.\n\nIt was truly beautiful weather.\n\nThe weather was two steps ahead of summer and one step behind winter.\n\nThe cool air, with just the right amount of warmth from the sunlight, touched her heart dryly.\n\n\"Haaa...\"\n\nMargaret took a deep breath, savoring the freshness that surrounded her.\n\nThe scent of autumn in the air seemed to add flavor to the cool weather.\n\nShe walked towards the light carriage stop, a small smile gracing her lips.\n\nHowever, that small smile didn't last long.\n\nBecause in the distance, she saw a boy.\n\n\"......\"\n\nHis hair contained a quiet darkness even in broad daylight.\n\nAs far as Margaret knew, there was only one person in the Academy with such distinctive hair color.\n\n\"...Raiden.\"\n\nShe muttered his name unconsciously and slowed down.\n\nIt was because she remembered the 'Second Year School Trip Group Arrangement' she had checked yesterday.\n\nThe group list she was on with Raiden.\n\nRemembering it, Margaret frowned slightly.\n\nIt was as if a nightmarish voice was ringing in her ears.\n\n-Ha, what an ugly face.\n\n-It's none of your business who I mess around with.\n\n-Pfft... Love, you say? Don't make me laugh. Get lost.\n\nThose were the words that flashed through her mind reflexively whenever she thought of Raiden.\n\nAnd even now, two years later, they are still painful memories.\n\nMargaret bit her lip to forget the pain in her chest.\n\nShe stood there for a moment, then let out a sigh.\n\nShe brushed aside her distorted expression.\n\n\"What am I doing... I decided to forget all about those things...\"\n\nMargaret muttered to herself sarcastically and started walking again.\n\nThere weren't many carriage stops near the dormitory, so she couldn't avoid them.\n\n\"Huh, huh...? This group arrangement is...\"\n\n\"How could such a combination be born...\"\n\nAs she got closer to the stop, the sound of the boy and his companions' conversation began to reach her ears.\n\nJudging from what she could hear, it seemed like they were looking at the group list that had been posted yesterday.\n\nMargaret walked up behind them, her footsteps echoing softly.\n\nRaiden was groaning, holding his forehead in front of the bulletin board.\n\nBeside him were Ariel and Lucy, their faces a mixture of emotions.\n\nMargaret decided to greet Lucy first as a matter of courtesy.\n\nShe put her hands together neatly and bowed her head slightly.\n\nAt that moment, she heard it.\n\n\"Ahem, it is an honor to meet the Star of the Empire...\"\n\n\"What a shitty group formation.\"\n\nRaiden's mutterings pierced through the air.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Huh?\"\n\nRaiden, who was nodding at Margaret's question, seemed to realize something was wrong and turned around.\n\nAnd in that instant, their eyes met.\n\n\"....\"\n\n\"....\"\n\nRaiden's face stiffened, his complexion gradually turning pale.\n\nThe same went for Ariel and Lucy, who were next to him.\n\n\"Lady Phyler...?\"\n\nRaiden stammered in surprise.\n\nMargaret clenched her fists.\n\n\"It's shitty, you say?\"\n\n\"N-no... that's not...\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nRaiden closed his mouth at her sharp retort.\n\nMargaret glared at him, biting her lip.\n\n-Rip...\n\nHer lip, which she had been chewing on since earlier, finally tore, unable to withstand the force.\n\nThe metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.\n\nMargaret stared at Raiden with cold eyes.\n\nSomething was overflowing inside her.\n\n\"I'm sorry you dislike me so much, Young Master Lishite.\"\n\n\"That's not...\"\n\n\"How much do you hate me to use such a vulgar expression as 'shitty'?\"\n\n\"No, it just slipped out...\"\n\n\"So much so that your true feelings slip out unconsciously?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nUnable to refute Margaret's continuous attacks, Raiden lowered his head, accepting defeat.\n\nThe air around the carriage stop was heavy.\n\nThe only sound that broke the suffocating silence was the ringing of a bell, signaling the imminent arrival of a carriage.\n\n-Ring-a-ling...\n\nAs the carriage pulled into the stop, Margaret turned and headed towards it.\n\nAnd just before she got on,\n\n\"You're the worst.\"\n\nWithout looking back, Margaret muttered those words and boarded the carriage.\n\nRaiden and his companions could only watch in stunned silence as the carriage carrying Margaret disappeared into the distance.\n\n***\n\n\"Ha...\"\n\nThe first to break the silence at the frozen carriage stop was my sigh.\n\nI grabbed my throbbing head and slumped down on a bench.\n\n\"Does this even make sense...\"\n\nThis wasn't some cheap drama, so why was Margaret there?\n\nThanks to her, I missed the carriage, and the mood was ruined.\n\nAs I scratched my head with a groan, Lucy, who was next to me, nudged me.\n\n\"Raiden...\"\n\n\"Yes...?\"\n\n\"That was Lady Phyler just now... right?\"\n\nShe had an incredulous look on her face.\n\nPerhaps Lucy was seeing this cold side of Margaret for the first time.\n\nAfter all, Margaret was the idol of the second years, a girl who was smart, kind, beautiful, and warm to everyone.\n\n\"I... I've never seen Margaret talk like that...\"\n\n\"M-me neither... I bumped into her a few times with you before, and she was definitely...\"\n\nI smiled wryly at Lucy and Ariel, who were both in a state of panic.\n\nDamn it, the field trip hadn't even started, and it was already like this...\n\nWhat was I thinking, calling it \"shitty\" in front of her?\n\nI scolded myself, tapping my forehead.\n\nAs I sat there blankly, drumming my fingers on my forehead like a monk striking a wooden fish, Ariel, who was glancing at the bulletin board, pointed to the bottom of the group list and asked,\n\n\"By the way, brother, do you know who Golden Boy and Violet are?\"\n\nI answered her indifferently.\n\n\"There's this guy named Golden Boy, he's a bit... special. I think he might have hit his head when he was younger.\"\n\n\"Golden Boy is his name? What a peculiar name.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it...\"\n\nI didn't know until a few weeks ago either.\n\nThat Golden Boy guy's real name was, in fact, Golden Boy.\n\nWas this... right?\n\nWhy was there a name like 'Golden Boy' in a fantasy world?\n\nIt was like someone in my previous life being named 'Blindingly Bright Shining Sunlight'.\n\nMaybe the author who wrote the original story was Korean...\n\nI don't know.\n\nMy head was spinning.\n\nAriel mumbled with interest at my answer.\n\n\"Oh... That's an interesting name. I'd like to meet him some time...\"\n\n\"Absolutely not.\"\n\nI cut her off firmly.\n\nAriel meeting Golden Boy?\n\nNot before my head gets chopped off... no, not even after that.\n\n\"He's a bad person.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, so you shouldn't try to meet him, okay?\"\n\n\"Hmm... If you say so, brother, I understand!\"\n\nAfter a moment of contemplation, Ariel nodded.\n\nI patted her head at her obedience.\n\n\"Good girl.\"\n\n\"Hehe...\"\n\nAriel giggled and leaned into my touch.\n\nShe purred like a cat for a moment before asking another question.\n\n\"Brother, then do you know who Violet is?\"\n\n\"Ah, Violet is... wait, what?\"\n\n\"Huh...?\"\n\nI looked down at Ariel, wondering if I had misheard.\n\nShe blinked at me as if wondering what was wrong.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Did you just say... Violet?\"\n\n\"Yeah, she's in your group, right?\"\n\nI followed Ariel's gaze.\n\nThe name 'Violet' was clearly written on the list.\n\nThe impact of Margaret and Golden Boy being listed above was so strong that I must have missed it.\n\nI stared at the name for a moment, frozen.\n\n\"Violet... is in the same group...?\"\n\n\"Hmm? Do you know her too?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nOf course, I did.\n\nPerhaps better than anyone else in this world.\n\nAfter all, the girl named Violet...\n\nWas the mid-boss that appeared in Volume 5 of the original novel, 'Sorrow-erasing heroes'.\n\n\"Violet, the Purple Monster...\"\n\nAnd at the same time...\n\nShe was the character I adored the most in the original story.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Did I overdo it today...?\"\n\nI should put on some muscle patches.\n\nWith that thought, Changho opened his locker.\n\nPerhaps because it was late, the locker room was empty, not a soul in sight.\n\nChangho sighed as he took in the eerie atmosphere of the place.\n\n\"Phew... I should hurry up and change, and go grab some dinner~\"\n\nChangho hummed a tune as he changed.\n\nThat's when it happened.\n\n\"Sob... sniff...\"\n\n\"......?\"\n\nA faint sound of crying reached Changho's ears.\n\nHe felt a chill run down his spine and stared into the corner of the locker room where the noise was coming from.\n\n'B-but, I'm sure there was no one there...?'\n\nHe held his breath and strained his ears, wondering if he had heard wrong.\n\n\"Sniff... sob... uhh...\"\n\n\"......!\"\n\nFaint as it was, it was definitely the sound of someone crying.\n\nA cold sweat began to run down Changho's back.\n\nHe hurriedly grabbed the bamboo sword that was lying on the floor and gripped it tightly.\n\nThe tip of the trembling sword pointed towards the darkness.\n\nIn that state, Changho slowly walked toward the source of the sound.\n\nIt was like a scene straight out of a horror movie.\n\nThe cliché where someone senses something strange from an unknown sound moves to check it out, and ends up missing the next day.\n\n\"Oh... Lord.\"\n\nChangho made the sign of the cross in the air, seeking the Lord he didn't even believe in.\n\nGripping the bamboo sword tightly, Changho slowly approached the corner of the locker room where the sound of crying was coming from.\n\n\"Namu Amitabha, Hallelujah...\"\n\nChangho muttered a rather unsettling prayer that crossed between Buddhism and Christianity.\n\nHe took a deep breath and opened his eyes wide, charging towards the den of evil where wicked whispers seemed to boil.\n\n\"Who's there!!!\"\n\nA loud shout echoed through the silent locker room.\n\nBut the only response to Changho's shout was a small voice.\n\n\"U-uhh...?\"\n\n\"......Huh?\"\n\nAt the somewhat familiar voice, Changho frowned and looked back into the darkness.\n\nThere, sitting huddled in a ball, was a young boy.\n\n\"Naru...?\"\n\n\"......?\"\n\nRecognizing him, Changho muttered the boy's name in a daze.\n\nNaru tilted his head as if asking why he was being called.\n\n\"Haaa... You scared the crap out of me...\"\n\nFinally understanding the situation, Changho let out a sigh of relief and lowered the bamboo sword.\n\nHe calmed his pounding heart for a moment before moving next to Naru.\n\n\"Naru... what are you doing here at this hour...\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nNaru didn't answer.\n\nChangho stood in front of him and gently stroked his hair.\n\n\"I heard you crying... Did something happen...?\"\n\n-Shake, shake...\n\nNaru shook his head.\n\n\"Then why...\"\n\n-Flap, flap.\n\nNaru waved his arms excitedly, showing what he was holding in his hand.\n\n\"What's this...? Hmm? Isn't this the book I lent you?\"\n\nIn Naru's hand was a book.\n\nTo be precise, it was Volume 5 of the 'Sorrow-erasing heroes' series.\n\nNaru moved his hands excitedly as if trying to say something.\n\nChangho asked, flustered by Naru's appearance.\n\n\"So... you were reading the book and crying because it was so sad?\"\n\n-Nod, nod.\n\nNaru nodded his head vigorously.\n\nThen he suddenly opened the book to the middle and pointed to a passage.\n\nChangho looked at the part Naru was pointing at and nodded in understanding.\n\nIt was the scene where the mid-boss from Volume 5, a character named 'Violet', died.\n\n\"I see, you were reading this part?\"\n\n\"U-uhh...\"\n\n\"This part was a bit sad.\"\n\n\"Sob...\"\n\nNaru sniffled again.\n\nChangho gave him a helpless look and wiped away his flowing tears.\n\n\"Oh my... You've really fallen for this book.\"\n\n-Nod...\n\nAs Naru nodded timidly, Changho ruffled his hair and asked,\n\n\"What about dinner? Have you eaten?\"\n\n-Shake, shake...\n\n\"Let's go eat together. I'm going to secretly order chicken tonight.\"\n\n-Nod, nod!\n\nNaru's eyes sparkled at the word 'chicken'.\n\nChangho chuckled at his reaction and held out his hand.\n\n\"Shall we go?\"\n\n-Nod, nod!\n\nNaru took Changho's hand and left the locker room.\n\nOnce again, they were a very affectionate pair of brothers.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-Rattle, rattle...\n\nI stared blankly out the window of the swaying carriage.\n\nAs I pondered the random thoughts that came to mind, I couldn't help but let out a sigh.\n\n\"Haa...\"\n\nWhat was weighing on my mind was the thought of a certain girl.\n\nIt was the thought of the character I adored the most while reading the original 10-volume novel.\n\n'Violet...'\n\nViolet.\n\nThe mid-boss who appeared in Volume 5 of the original work.\n\nWhy had I forgotten about her existence?\n\nIf the world I was reincarnated into was the world of 'Sorrow-erasing heroes', then naturally, she would be alive and well.\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nI let out a small groan and picked up a few pieces from the worries that were bothering me.\n\nThe time when Violet awakens as a villain is about a year later.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nThe most logical way would be to eliminate her before she falls into villainy.\n\nIf I used a little bit of my status and family power, it wouldn't be difficult to get rid of a commoner with no particular connections.\n\nBut could that really be called the right answer?\n\nI am a reincarnator.\n\nIn other words, I am someone who knows the entire contents of the original work, 'Sorrow-erasing heroes'.\n\nTherefore, I know better than anyone what kind of misfortune Violet went through and how she broke down.\n\nAs someone who shed tears at her sorrow.\n\nAs someone who smiled at her joy.\n\nAs someone who met an end similar to hers.\n\nI didn't want Violet's story to end in tragedy.\n\n'In that case, I...'\n\n...I don't know.\n\nEven if I wanted to help her, I didn't know how.\n\nAnd it was a bit ridiculous to think about helping someone else when I could barely handle myself.\n\nI guess I'll just have to wait and see.\n\nAfter all, there was still a year left.\n\nDuring the school trip... well, wouldn't it be enough to just get along with her?\n\nI shook off my thoughts and turned my gaze back to the passing scenery.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, as Raiden was lost in thought, Margaret arrived at the main building and was walking towards her classroom.\n\nHer beautiful crimson eyes were dull as she looked up.\n\nHer gaze was directed at the clear blue sky, but her mind was elsewhere.\n\n\"......\"\n\nMargaret pressed her hand to her forehead, a heavy silence hanging in the air.\n\nA throbbing headache made her lose her balance for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure.\n\n-...What a shitty group formation.\n\nThe events that had just transpired at the carriage stop replayed in her mind.\n\nHer silver eyebrows furrowed as a wave of unpleasant emotions washed over her.\n\nThe girl let out a low groan and muttered to herself.\n\n\"...I lost my composure, which is unlike me.\"\n\nWhy?\n\nIt was just one sentence.\n\nWhy had she lost her cool and gotten so agitated?\n\n\"He's nothing to me anymore.\"\n\nMargaret scoffed, a bitter taste filling her mouth.\n\nThe self-deprecating laughter seemed tinged with sadness.\n\nShe erased the smile from her lips and dove back into the waves of her thoughts.\n\nThe countless emotions that had consumed her at that moment when she confronted the boy.\n\nAnger, sadness, contempt, annoyance, and a faint lingering attachment.\n\nAll those colors, mixed together in a sticky mess, formed...\n\nDisappointment.\n\nYes, it was disappointment.\n\n\"Disappointment...\"\n\nWhat exactly was she disappointed about?\n\nShe had let go of everything related to him.\n\nIt was a fragment of her heart buried deep inside her.\n\nMemories of the past, they remained in her life like ink stains that she couldn't erase.\n\n\"...How foolish of me.\"\n\nMargaret quietly chastised herself.\n\nHow could she be so stupid?\n\nTo still harbor expectations even after being betrayed and hurt like that.\n\nThe hatred towards the boy had festered into maggots, gnawing away at her.\n\n\"Get a grip, Margaret Phyler...

It's not particularly noticeable. You have your usual poker face on.\"\n\n\"Then how...?\"\n\n\"Well, you could say it's experience?\"\n\nLucas said playfully with a kind smile.\n\nHis bright energy seemed to radiate outwards, making me frown slightly.\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Well, it's nothing much... I just thought something might be bothering you since you weren't focusing well during training today.\"\n\n\"I apologize.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean for you to apologize...? Now I sound like a grumpy old professor who scolds his student for spacing out!\"\n\nLucas scratched his head, stopping me from apologizing further.\n\nHe looked like he was at a loss for what to do with me.\n\nPutting down the crystal ball he was holding, he gently patted my shoulder.\n\n\"Raiden, you're... a bit too stiff.\"\n\n\"Are you saying my movements aren't fluid enough?\"\n\n\"No, I'm talking about your usual demeanor. You're too hard on yourself.\"\n\n\"You're telling me?\"\n\nI couldn't help but tilt my head in question at his words.\n\nHard on myself? Me?\n\nLucas continued, studying my puzzled expression.\n\n\"You act like someone who's constantly being chased by something. You whip yourself mercilessly and treat yourself harshly.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand...\"\n\n\"How many days have you taken a break from training in the past month?\"\n\n\"...None.\"\n\n\"And right after the banquet hall incident, you came to train the very next day after you were discharged?\"\n\n\"...Yes.\"\n\nI closed my mouth, rendered speechless by his words.\n\nEven I had to admit that going back to training the day after being discharged from the infirmary was a bit much.\n\nLucas observed me for a moment before speaking again, a wry smile on his face.\n\n\"You tend to push yourself too hard, Raiden.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"It's admirable, but it also worries me... People who are used to pushing themselves often neglect their own well-being.\"\n\nI'm guessing that's probably why you were feeling down today as well.\n\nYou were probably blaming yourself for some mistake, right?\n\nI've seen kids like you before.\n\nTrapped in their own disappointment and compulsions, they easily hate themselves for the smallest of things.\n\nTo me, you're no different... No, maybe even worse.\n\nI don't know all the details of your situation, but I just wanted to tell you this.\n\n\"It's going to be okay. You're doing well enough.\"\n\nThe hand that had been patting my shoulder moved to my head.\n\nHis touch, gently stroking my hair, held a strangely nostalgic warmth.\n\nThe memory of my brother, Changho, flashed through my mind, and I froze, unable to react.\n\n\"I know you're working harder than anyone else, Raiden... Why else do you think I'm giving you one-on-one lessons like this?\"\n\nHis tone was playful, but his words were sincere.\n\nHe told me that he acknowledged my efforts.\n\nThat he recognized the days I had struggled in this world for the past three months.\n\nAnd at the same time, he added that everything would be alright.\n\nProfessor Lucas didn't know my circumstances.\n\nHe didn't know about Raiden's hidden past, my reincarnation, or even my existence.\n\nBut even so.\n\nHis encouragement, telling me that I was doing well enough, was enough to shake me to my core.\n\nBecause since I had fallen into this world, he was the first person to acknowledge my efforts.\n\n\"...I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\nI managed to stammer out a reply, my body still frozen.\n\nI wanted to thank him, but the words felt awkward on my tongue, so I just mumbled something vague.\n\n\"Good to hear!\"\n\nLucas chuckled and ruffled my hair.\n\nEmbarrassed, I subtly dodged his hand and changed the subject.\n\n\"By the way, what's with the crystal ball you've been holding this whole time? It seems to be recording...\"\n\n\"Ah, this?\"\n\nLucas lifted the crystal ball at my question.\n\nHe seemed to ponder for a moment on how to explain it before shrugging.\n\n\"It's, how should I put it... I was recording my will, so to speak.\"\n\n\"......Excuse me?\"\n\nHis sudden, unexpected answer left me dumbfounded.\n\nMy surprise almost showed on my face, but I quickly regained my composure at his next words.\n\n\"Haha! Of course, not the kind of will you're thinking of.\"\n\n\"Then...?\"\n\n\"As you can see, this is a recording crystal ball. I record myself with it once a month.\"\n\n\"Is it a hobby?\"\n\n\"Well... more like a habit I picked up from the battlefield.\"\n\n\"Ah... So that's why you called it a will.\"\n\nI nodded in understanding.\n\nThe civil war that had thrown the Empire into chaos ten years ago, also known as the 'Lukria War of Conquest'.\n\nLucas had participated in that hell at the young age of fourteen.\n\nIt was a fierce war where death could come at any moment, so it made sense that he would record his will periodically.\n\nAnd after the war ended, it must have become a habit.\n\n\"Will... It's a strange way to put it now. Now that the era of peace has arrived.\"\n\n\"That's fortunate.\"\n\n\"Thanks to that, this habit has changed a lot too. These days, it's more like setting goals for the month ahead before it begins.\"\n\nIn other words, he was using it as a planner.\n\nI looked at the crystal ball, which showed signs of age and fell into thought.\n\nIt looked fine now, but there must have been a time when blood and tears fell on it.\n\nThrown into hell at an age when he should have been experiencing the sweetness of the world, how lonely and afraid he must have been.\n\nPerhaps Lucas and I were a little alike.\n\nIn the sense that we learned coldness before warmth from others.\n\n\"......\"\n\nLost in bitter thoughts, I remained silent.\n\nAs if reading my mind, Lucas smiled.\n\n\"You're right... That war was nothing short of hell. But it wasn't all bad.\"\n\n\"Yes...?\"\n\n\"On the battlefield, overflowing with anger and sadness, I saw something.\"\n\nLucas's face was tinged with melancholy as he reminisced.\n\n\"Children... Innocent children who didn't lose their smiles even as they looked upon their burning hometowns.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Seeing them gave me hope. I felt like I could do anything to protect those bright smiles.\"\n\nThat's why I chose to become an educator.\n\nHe said, a kind smile gracing his lips.\n\nHis bright green eyes, sparkling with hope, were fixed on me.\n\n\"Hell is painful... but if you look closely, it might lead you to something precious.\"\n\nSo why don't you try looking too, Raiden?\n\n\"Look for what lies within your own hell.\"\n\nHis voice resonated clearly in my ears.\n\nI could only stare blankly, replaying his words in my mind.\n\nThe self that had stopped moving, exhausted from misfortune and despair, felt like it was wriggling back to life.\n\nHis words weren't mere consolation.\n\nLucas was encouraging me.\n\nHe was telling me that I could escape hell too, just like he did.\n\nHe was trying to give me courage.\n\nIs this what it means to be an adult?\n\nOf all the people I've met in my life, he was the one most deserving of the title 'adult'.\n\n\"...Thank you for your kind words.\"\n\nI finally managed to stammer out a reply, my body still stiff.\n\n\"I only ever give good advice, don't I? You should always keep your ears peeled.\"\n\nLucas responded playfully to my blunt reply.\n\nHe stood up and said, shaking the crystal ball in his hand.\n\n\"Alright! Since you're here, Raiden... how about I make it my goal for this month to hear you call me 'Master'?\"\n\n\"Excuse me? What are you talking about all of a sudden...?\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's about time you started calling me Master? You're the only student in the Academy who inherited my unique magic, so I'd say that makes us master and disciple, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Since you're a professor and I'm a student, aren't we already in a teacher-student relationship...?\"\n\n\"Then call me Master from now on.\"\n\n\"I'll call you Professor.\"\n\n\"How can you be so cruel...!\"\n\nLucas looked at me with a betrayed expression.\n\nI averted my gaze, sticking to my guns.\n\nI barely managed to thank him, and now he wanted me to call him 'Master'?\n\nPlease, let's stay within the realm of possibility.\n\n\"Just you wait...! I've set it as my goal for this month!\"\n\nLucas declared with a stubborn glint in his eye.\n\nI noticed this every time I saw him, but this guy had a tendency to fixate on strange things.\n\nAs a result, I had to continue my training under Lucas's intense gaze.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd so, the lively days passed, and the dreaded day of the school trip finally arrived.\n\nNo matter how much I wished it wouldn't, time was not something I could stop.\n\nIn the end, I had no choice but to grudgingly accept reality.\n\n\"Young Master, did you pack everything?\"\n\nAs I stood there with my bag, lost in the despair of the natural order of things, Rachel emerged from the kitchen, where she had been washing dishes, and asked.\n\nI nodded and replied,\n\n\"I packed earlier.\"\n\n\"Then what's this?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nRachel held something out in front of me.\n\nIn her hand was a navy blue vest embroidered with the Reynolds Academy emblem.\n\nWait, wasn't that my uniform...?\n\n\"...I thought I packed it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Young Master... I knew it.\"\n\n\"Ha, haha... Thanks, Ray.\"\n\nRachel gave me an exasperated look as she put the uniform in my bag.\n\nShe closed the bag and patted it.\n\n\"Honestly~ I'm worried about how you'll manage for five days without me~\"\n\n\"......I know, right?\"\n\nHer playful words made my heart sink.\n\nFive days without Rachel, without Ariel.\n\nFive days in an unfamiliar place with people I didn't want to be around.\n\nCould I really endure it?\n\n\"Young Master...?\"\n\nSensing my unease, Rachel called out to me, her voice laced with concern.\n\n\"Are you alright...?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nI stayed silent for a moment before speaking.\n\n\"Rachel.\"\n\n\"Yes, Young Master.\"\n\n\"...Do you think I can do this? Five days without you.\"\n\nMy voice trembled slightly as I asked.\n\nRachel looked at me silently for a moment before answering with a bright smile.\n\n\"Of course, who do you think raised you?\"\n\nHer answer was as if I had asked something obvious.\n\nHer clear eyes held my reflection, a gentle gaze fixed on me.\n\nFor some reason, my face flushed at her soft gaze, and I averted my eyes.\n\n\"...What are you talking about? You're only a year older.\"\n\n\"Hehe... I practically raised you!\"\n\n\"It wasn't that bad.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was~\"\n\nTalking with Rachel, even casually, eased my anxiety.\n\nI took a deep breath and gripped the strap of my bag tightly.\n\n\"Well then... I'll be back.\"\n\n\"Yes, take care!\"\n\nWith Rachel's cheerful farewell, I opened the front door and stepped outside.\n\nThe sky, overcast with scattered clouds, shone down on me with the occasional ray of sunshine.\n\nWith mixed feelings, I stepped into the scene before me.\n\nThe school trip had begun.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "The Outcasts Assemble\n\nThe journey to our destination was quite a long one.\n\nWe had to switch carriages twice before arriving at the harbor, and then board a large ship to cross the sea.\n\nI heard the destination was an island owned by the Academy, but why so far...?\n\n\"Ha...\"\n\nI leaned against the railing, letting out a soft sigh.\n\nGlancing down, I could see the hull of the ship cutting through the surface of the water.\n\nThe spray from the occasional wave that crashed against the ship sparkled in the sunlight.\n\n-Splash! Crash...\n\nThe blue sea shimmered brilliantly under the dazzling sunlight.\n\nA cool sea breeze carried the salty scent of the ocean.\n\nI rested my chin on my hand, mesmerized by the refreshing salty air that brushed against the tip of my nose.\n\n\"...This is boring.\"\n\nHow many hours had I spent killing time like this?\n\nLooking at the sea was fun at first, but now, with the same scenery repeating endlessly, I could only yawn.\n\nIn my past life, I used to travel by plane in an instant for competitions.\n\nDid no one in this world ever think of flying through the sky?\n\nI stretched, feeling the absence of a certain great brother of mine.\n\nAs I extended my stiff limbs, I could hear the satisfying pops and cracks of my back.\n\nJust then, a voice reached my ears.\n\n\"Whoa~ Someone's got a killer aura going on. You gonna off someone or something?\"\n\nA frivolous yet distinct, lighthearted tone.\n\nRecognizing the owner of the voice instantly, I turned around, muttering his name.\n\n\"Golden Boy.\"\n\nStanding there was a blonde, tanned delinquent, dressed in his usual sloppy attire.\n\nHe was fiddling with a pair of black sunglasses perched on his nose.\n\nHis fashion sense, which screamed 'beach bum', made me instinctively frown.\n\nNoticing my gaze, Golden Boy spread his arms wide and shouted,\n\n\"Woohoo wwww! Look what we have here! The academy's S-rank maniac!!\"\n\n\"...What's with the disrespectful tone?\"\n\n\"So-lucky☆!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nSeeing my icy glare at his ridiculous remark, Golden Boy, who had been grinning foolishly, flinched a little.\n\n\"Just kidding... You're hurting my feelings, Professor.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"...You're no fun.\"\n\nPouting, Golden Boy sauntered over to me and leaned against the railing, mirroring my posture.\n\nHe stretched lazily, his back to the backdrop of the sparkling blue sea.\n\n\"Ugh... When are we gonna get there?\"\n\n\"Professor Lucas said we'll be there in about two hours.\"\n\n\"So bored...\"\n\nGolden Boy grumbled, letting out a long yawn.\n\nI silently agreed with him.\n\nCome to think of it, there was a large open space at the back of the ship. Maybe we could have a spar there.\n\nAnd conveniently, there he was, a walking, talking punching bag right next to me.\n\nI turned my gaze towards Golden Boy and spoke,\n\n\"I saw that the space at the back of the ship is quite spacious. How about a light spar...\"\n\n\"Rejected.\"\n\n\"Your rejection is rejected. Let's go.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on...\"\n\nI grabbed the back of the neck of the sandbag who was subtly trying to make a run for it.\n\nWhere did he think he was going?\n\nIt wouldn't be as fun as sparring with Professor Lucas, but this guy was quite satisfying to hit.\n\nHe would have to suffice as a training partner for now.\n\nI dragged him by the back of his neck towards the rear of the ship.\n\nAnd so, until the ship reached its destination...\n\nUnknown sounds of impact and screams echoed across the deck.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSeveral hours passed.\n\nThe ship, which had been sailing across the blue expanse, finally reached its destination.\n\n\"Alright, everyone! We've arrived at our destination!\"\n\nSharon, the homeroom professor of Class Xenon, announced energetically, and the students, who had been bored out of their minds, erupted in cheers.\n\n\"Wooohoooo!!\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nAmong them was Golden Boy, who had been sparring with me until just a moment ago.\n\nHe rubbed his bruised arms and yelled,\n\n\"Freedom!! Get lost, you crazy bastard!!! I'm outta here!!!\"\n\nHe threw down the practice mace he had been holding and gave me a defiant middle finger.\n\nI tilted my head, looking at him.\n\nWhat was wrong with him? Did he short-circuit or something?\n\nDid I hit him too hard?\n\nI let out a chuckle, a hint of concern in my voice.\n\n\"Hmm, where are you going? We're in the same group, remember?\"\n\n\"...Oh, shit.\"\n\nAs if he had just remembered that fact, Golden Boy smacked his forehead and cursed.\n\nHe let out an awkward laugh and looked at me sheepishly.\n\n\"You... you know how much I love you, right...?\"\n\n\"How about another spar during free time?\"\n\n\"I'm so screwed...\"\n\nGolden Boy's face fell as he picked up the mace he had thrown down.\n\n\"Professor... you're gonna let me live, right?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"You are... right...?\"\n\nGolden Boy wailed.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAs we disembarked the ship, exchanging pointless banter, we could see the other students who had already gotten off.\n\nThe bustling scene was clearly that of teenagers excited to be on a 'school trip'.\n\nGolden Boy and I steered clear of the lively crowd, heading towards the outskirts of the group.\n\n\"Wow~ Everyone seems so excited.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they all seem to have high expectations.\"\n\n\"Of course they do, dummy! It's a school trip! A. School. Trip!\"\n\nGolden Boy, who was just as excited as the others, shouted 'Woohoo wwww!' as he threw his arms up in the air.\n\nEmbarrassed by his antics, I subtly distanced myself from him.\n\n\"Hey, what are you doing? Come on!\"\n\n\"Get away from me.\"\n\n\"Agh! You're so mean!!\"\n\nAs I was trying to escape from the clingy Golden Boy, one of the professors who was leading the students shouted.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "\"Everyone, listen up!!!!\"\n\nHis voice boomed, almost as if he were trying to shake our eardrums.\n\nIt was Aron, the bulky homeroom professor of Class Liel.\n\nHe clapped his magic-infused hands together, drawing the attention of the students.\n\n-Boom! Boom! Boom!!!\n\n\"Silence!\"\n\nI frowned at the deafening sound that rang in my ears.\n\nWait, did he just clap his hands? Why did it sound like a cannon had gone off?\n\n\"Attention, everyone! After a long journey, we have finally arrived at Calderan Island, the destination of our school trip.\"\n\n\"\"Wooohoooo!!!\"\"\n\n\"As you all know, this school trip will be conducted based on the groups that were formed earlier. Please get along with your group members for the next three days!\"\n\n\"\"Yes, sir!!!\"\"\n\n\"This school trip will be in the form of camping. Enjoy nature to your heart's content, and set up your tents for camping in the evening. You've all been briefed on this beforehand, so I trust you're all aware of it?\"\n\n\"\"Yes, sir!!!\"\"\n\n\"Are there any students here who would like to say, 'I am a high-ranking noble, so I cannot possibly participate in something as barbaric as camping'?\"\n\n\"\"No, sir!!!\"\"\n\n\"A true noble should be able to maintain their dignity even in the rawness of nature. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"\"Yes, sir!!!\"\"\n\n\"Then, make sure to gather back here before dinner time, without exception.\"\n\n\"\"Yes, sir!!!\"\"\n\nThe students responded enthusiastically to every word that came out of Aaron's mouth.\n\nIt was like witnessing a cult gathering, and I couldn't help but let out a sigh of mixed emotions.\n\nMaking these pampered noble brats go camping...\n\nWasn't he afraid of backlash from the students?\n\nWell... who would dare to challenge Korn, a woman who could take on an entire marquis' family single-handedly?\n\n'Still, isn't camping a bit too much...'\n\nI grumbled internally, tears welling up in my eyes.\n\nAs if suffering from insomnia wasn't bad enough, now I had to endure camping on top of it?\n\nI thought school trips meant staying at luxurious hotels on the island. Guess I was wrong.\n\nThis place was a remote island, to begin with. There wasn't a single house in sight, let alone a hotel.\n\n'I want to run away already.'\n\nI was already missing the comfort of my dorm room with Rachel and Ariel.\n\nAs I was wallowing in my silent complaints, Aron clapped his hands again and shouted.\n\n-Boom! Boom!!\n\n\"Now, gather with your assigned groups! Once everyone is assembled, we'll begin our activities!\"\n\n-Thump! Thump! Thump!\n\nThe students scrambled around at Aron's words.\n\nI shook my head at the chaotic scene.\n\n\"I can't understand why they're so excited.\"\n\nGolden Boy, who was standing next to me, glanced at the commotion and muttered,\n\n\"You poor soul... You don't know the beauty of a school trip...\"\n\n\"I know the beauty of a good spar. You want to experience it firsthand?\"\n\n\"Actually, you don't look that pitiful.\"\n\n\"Too late.\"\n\n\"Damn it.\"\n\nAs Golden Boy pleaded for his life, having been sentenced to another round of sparring, two students approached us.\n\nOne was Margaret, the girl with dazzling silver hair and alluring crimson eyes.\n\n\"...Greetings, Lady Phyler.\"\n\nHer sudden appearance startled me, and I greeted her with a stiff bow.\n\nThe incident at the carriage stop a few days ago flashed through my mind.\n\n\"Yes. It's nice to see you again, Young Master Lishite.\"\n\nI highly doubted she meant it.\n\nMargaret gave me a curt reply and turned her attention to Golden Boy.\n\n\"Is your name... Golden... Boy?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. That's right.\"\n\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Margaret Phyler of the Phyler family.\"\n\nHer voice was friendly and polite, a stark contrast to her previous tone.\n\nHer completely different attitude towards him made me let out an awkward cough.\n\nWell... I couldn't really blame her, considering my past actions.\n\n\"Haha! Just call me Boy!\"\n\n\"Yes. Pleased to meet you, Boy.\"\n\nThe two of them continued their conversation amicably.\n\nI let out a sigh and shifted my gaze.\n\nThat's when my eyes met with those of a girl who was standing awkwardly a few steps away from Margaret.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nThe sight of her made my breath hitch in my throat.\n\nShe had shoulder-length purple hair and violet eyes that seemed to tremble slightly.\n\nHer posture was timid, and her frame seemed delicate.\n\nAnd...\n\nA bandage covered the entire right side of her face.\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nI stared at her, completely mesmerized.\n\nThe girl I had only seen in the illustrations of the original novel was standing right before my eyes.\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"...Ah, uh...\"\n\nAs if feeling self-conscious under my intense gaze, Violet raised her hand to cover her bandaged face.\n\nI snapped out of my daze and looked away.\n\n'…Right, Violet hated showing her face to others.'\n\nI pushed down the bitter smile that threatened to surface and approached her.\n\nThen, I greeted her casually.\n\n\"I don't think we've met. I'm Raiden Lishite.\"\n\n\"Eek! Hicc, hiccup...\"\n\nViolet flinched at my outstretched hand and started hiccuping.\n\nShe fidgeted nervously, like a frightened puppy, unsure of what to do.\n\n'Even her personality is exactly like in the original...'\n\nTimid, easily frightened, and quiet.\n\nIn other words, the typical pushover.\n\nViolet trembled for a moment before finally taking my hand and bowing deeply.\n\n\"V-Violet... It's an honor to meet you, Your Grace... Hiccup.\"\n\nHer voice was barely a whisper, and her words were laced with nervousness.\n\nEven as we shook hands, her eyes darted around, avoiding mine at all costs.\n\nSensing the warmth of her hand, which felt like it could crumble at any moment, a wave of sympathy washed over me.\n\nTo think that this fragile girl would become a villain in a year's time.\n\nI bit my lip, trying to suppress the complicated emotions that surged within me.\n\nAs a heavy silence fell between us, Golden Boy suddenly wedged himself between Violet and me.\n\n\"Yo~! Nice to meet you, I'm Golden Boy! We're both commoners, so you can drop the formalities.\"\n\n\"Hiccup... O-okay...\"\n\nHis overly friendly greeting made my skin crawl, and I couldn't help but smack him on the back of his head.\n\n-Whack!\n\n\"Ouch! What was that for?!\"\n\n\"What do you mean 'we're both commoners'? I'm a noble, you idiot. Why would I want her to drop the formalities?\"\n\nGolden Boy winced, rubbing the back of his head.\n\n\"Well... you're not really acting like a noble...\"\n\n\"Oh really? Go on, finish that sentence.\"\n\n\"Y-you're just... too dignified!\"\n\nAs I rolled up my sleeves threateningly, Golden Boy quickly backpedaled.\n\nHe forced a laugh and changed the subject.\n\n\"Haha... By the way, isn't it interesting?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Our group has all three members of the academy's official outcast trio.\"\n\nViolet flinched at Golden Boy's words, her body trembling slightly.\n\nWhy would he say something like that? What an idiot.\n\nI glared at Golden Boy, who was shouting \"Woohoo wwww!\" and smacked him on the back of his head again.\n\n-Whack!\n\n\"Ouch! Why'd you hit me again?!\"\n\n\"Show some sensitivity, you moron.\"\n\n\"I'm part of the outcast trio too, you know?\"\n\n\"Just shut up.\"\n\nGolden Boy looked at me with a confused expression, clearly not understanding what he had done wrong.\n\nI sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose in exasperation.\n\nWell… as you might have guessed by now…\n\nThe final member of the academy's official outcast trio, alongside Golden Boy and me, was…\n\nThe girl with purple hair standing next to us.\n\nThe Purple Monster, Violet.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Another  on reaching 5 reviews.Guardians of Purity\n\nThe school trip was very loosely structured.\n\nThere was no set schedule from the Academy.\n\nIt was simply a matter of exploring the vast island with our group members.\n\n'Is this normal...?'\n\nWas this what a typical school trip was like?\n\nDropping students off on a deserted island and letting them entertain themselves?\n\nI wouldn't know.\n\nI'd never been on a school trip before.\n\nWhile my classmates went on their trips, I was stuck in the training hall.\n\nOf course, that was my father's doing.\n\n\"...\"\n\nCome to think of it, that man had taken a lot from me.\n\nA heavy feeling settled in my chest as I exhaled slowly.\n\n\"Haa...\"\n\n\"What's with the sigh all of a sudden?\"\n\nThe idiot next to me looked over.\n\nI shoved away the milk chocolate-colored face that was getting too close for comfort.\n\n\"It's nothing. Get some space.\"\n\n\"Geez, I was barely even close...\"\n\nGolden Boy pouted at my disgusted reaction.\n\nI chuckled at his expression and slowly turned my head, taking in the surrounding scenery.\n\nThe clear blue sky filled my vision.\n\nBeyond it were streaks of bright, distinct clouds.\n\nThe warm sun beat down on a vast, sprawling meadow, an endless expanse of green.\n\nWe were walking through a picturesque landscape straight out of a fairytale.\n\n\"Wow... It's so beautiful here! Don't you think so, Violet?\"\n\n\"Eek... Y-yes! I think so too!\"\n\nMargaret and Violet's voices rang out from beside me, engaged in a friendly conversation.\n\nMargaret, with her usual affability, was chatting Violet up.\n\nViolet seemed a little overwhelmed... but it was probably fine.\n\nMargaret wasn't going to bite, after all.\n\n\"You know, this place is more interesting than I thought it would be.\"\n\n\"Yeah, not bad.\"\n\nI nodded in agreement with Golden Boy.\n\nIt wasn't chosen as a travel destination for nothing.\n\nThe island was quite beautiful, with its rare natural scenery and unique atmosphere that couldn't be found in the capital.\n\nMaybe this was what the Garden of Eden, where Adam and Eve lived, looked like.\n\n-Chirp, chirp, chirp...\n\nThe cheerful chirping of birds filled the air.\n\nThe meadow breeze carried a fresh, earthy scent.\n\nI took a deep breath, filling my lungs with the crisp autumn air.\n\nIt felt as if the constant worry and anxiety that clogged my throat had cleared away.\n\nPeaceful.\n\nI muttered to myself and reached into my pocket.\n\nMy fingers brushed against a small, smooth box.\n\nThe case containing the Death Weed.\n\nI pulled out a single Death Weed and put it in my mouth.\n\nThen, I took out my magic lighter and lit it.\n\n-Click, hiss...!\n\nAs a red flame sparked from the end of the stick, thick smoke filled my lungs.\n\nI exhaled the smoke that filled my breath and tapped the end of the stick lightly.\n\n\"Haaa...\"\n\nThis hit the spot.\n\nThe hazy sensation of the Death Weed mixed with the fresh scent of grass created a unique feeling.\n\n\"Ugh... were you smoking?\"\n\n\"It's not a cigarette.\"\n\nI replied to Golden Boy, who was subtly putting some distance between us, and took another drag.\n\nNow that I thought about it... was I addicted?\n\nI found myself reaching for the Death Weed even when I wasn't feeling down.\n\n\"Boy! Shall we go over there?\"\n\nMargaret, who had suddenly turned towards us, called out to Golden Boy.\n\n...She knew I was here too, but she didn't even bother asking me.\n\n\"Yes, Lady Phyler. Where are you referring to?\"\n\n\"Over that hill, where the other students are gathered!\"\n\nMargaret pointed to a spot where about twenty students were gathered, seemingly looking at something.\n\nGolden Boy tilted his head.\n\n\"What's over there?\"\n\n\"Hmm... the map just says 'Garden of Purity'. There's no other explanation.\"\n\n\"There must be something there. Let's go check it out.\"\n\n\"Okay! Violet, you coming?\"\n\n\"Y-yes...! I'll come too!\"\n\nThe three of them chatted happily as they walked away.\n\nI was left alone, staring blankly at their retreating figures.\n\nHey... what about me...?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"What's with the long face? You sulking?\"\n\nAs I walked with a sullen expression, Golden Boy nudged me with his elbow and asked.\n\nA smug grin was plastered across his face.\n\n\"Don't tell me you're upset because we went off without you.\"\n\n\"...Don't be ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Look at you, so petty. This isn't the magnanimity I'd expect from the academy's S-rank maniac.\"\n\n-Whack!\n\nI couldn't hold back any longer and smacked the back of his head.\n\nGolden Boy cried out in pain, clutching his head as if I'd just mortally wounded him.\n\n\"Ow! What was that for?!\"\n\n\"Maybe you should watch your mouth.\"\n\n\"What the hell, man! You hit me every chance you get!\"\n\n\"That's because you're always asking for it.\"\n\nHe really was an idiot.\n\nWho else in the world would dare to mess with the eldest son of the Lishite Dukedom so casually?\n\nEven the Academy students who badmouthed me behind my back could only tremble in fear when I was around.\n\nDid this guy have a death wish or something?\n\nI sighed and smacked him on the back of his head again.\n\n-Whack!\n\n\"Ow! What was that for this time?!\"\n\n\"No one disrespects the Lishite family like you do in this entire Empire.\"\n\n\"I never disrespected the Lishite family! I disrespect you, sure, but not your family.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThis guy was hopeless.\n\n-Whack!\n\n\"Argh!! Why, why, why!!!\"\n\n\"I don't know, you tell me.\"\n\n-Whack! Whack!\n\n\"Ugh!

      "content": "While Raiden was busy playing a death march on the back of Golden Boy's head, their group arrived at the 'Garden of Purity' Margaret had mentioned.\n\nAs they had seen earlier, a considerable number of students were milling about.\n\nMargaret muttered as she observed them.\n\n\"Hmm... What could be here that's drawing everyone's attention?\"\n\n\"Well... It's called the Garden of Purity, but the name doesn't tell us much...\"\n\nAt first glance, it looked no different from an ordinary meadow.\n\nThe group members looked around, their eyes searching for something interesting.\n\nJust as they were starting to get impatient, Golden Boy exclaimed.\n\n\"Hey, look over there! There's something!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Oh my god, those are...\"\n\nFollowing Golden Boy's gaze, the group members laid eyes on a sight that made them gasp.\n\nSeveral horses with pure white coats stood gracefully in the meadow.\n\nBut what set them apart from ordinary horses were the golden horns that adorned their heads.\n\n\"...Unicorns?\"\n\nMargaret's voice, barely a whisper, gave a name to the majestic creatures.\n\nTheir white coats seemed to shimmer with an ethereal glow, and their horns were held high with an air of nobility.\n\nAn aura of mystique surrounded them, giving them an almost spiritual presence.\n\nThe legendary Guardians of Purity, creatures they had only read about in books, were casually strolling through the meadow.\n\n\"Wow... I've never seen one in person before.\"\n\n\"Me neither. To think that such rare creatures like unicorns would be here... It's incredible.\"\n\nThe students gazed in awe at the unicorns, which snorted softly, their breath misting in the air.\n\nThese were endangered creatures, protected by Imperial law, and they were right there before their very eyes.\n\n***\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nI leaned against one of the trees in the center of the garden.\n\nThe other group members had excitedly run off to get a closer look at the unicorns as soon as they spotted them.\n\nI had a feeling Violet was practically dragged along by Margaret...\n\nBut well, at least it wasn't me this time.\n\nI settled into a more comfortable position, enjoying the scent of autumn in the air.\n\nAs my body relaxed and my gaze drifted towards the sky, I noticed the gentle swaying of the branches above me.\n\nThe leaves had turned a vibrant shade of red, embracing the colors of the season.\n\nThe cool shade of the tree provided a welcome respite from the sun, casting a soft shadow over my face.\n\nI could feel the rough bark of the tree against my back.\n\n\"...\"\n\nI stretched, savoring the moment of peace.\n\nPerhaps it was the accumulated fatigue from my insomnia, but my eyelids felt heavy.\n\nI let out a soft groan as my eyes fluttered shut.\n\nI couldn't fall asleep here. I might get a crick in my neck.\n\nWell... maybe not in this weather. It was pretty chilly.\n\n\"Haam...\"\n\nI tried to stay awake, but a yawn escaped my lips.\n\nA wave of exhaustion washed over me, weighing me down.\n\nIt felt as if gravity had increased fivefold.\n\nCome to think of it... I hadn't slept a wink last night, either, stuck on that ship...\n\nI was beyond exhausted.\n\nBut I couldn't fall asleep...\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nAs I shifted my position, fighting against the encroaching drowsiness, I sensed something moving beside me.\n\n-Rustle...\n\n\"......?\"\n\nAt first, I thought it might be Golden Boy, but then I reconsidered.\n\nHe wouldn't have been this quiet. He would have made a big entrance, as always.\n\nI opened my heavy eyelids and turned my head.\n\nThe first things that came into focus were pure white fur and a golden horn.\n\n\"What the... A unicorn?\"\n\n-Neigh! Snort...\n\nOne of the unicorns that had been frolicking in the meadow earlier was standing right before me.\n\nIt let out a soft nicker and lowered its head towards me.\n\nIts magnificent horn, gleaming in the sunlight, was pointed directly at me.\n\nI flinched instinctively, trying to appease the creature.\n\n\"Hey, I heard you guys are docile towards virgins...? I'm a virgin too, so please don't attack...?\"\n\nUnicorns were known as the Guardians of Purity.\n\nThey protected the innocent and punished the impure.\n\nBoth as Kim Naru and as Raiden, I was a virgin. I had no reason to incur their wrath.\n\nYet, despite knowing this, I couldn't help but feel intimidated by that smooth, iridescent horn.\n\nWhat would happen if I got stabbed by that thing...?\n\nI'd probably end up with a nice, big hole in my chest.\n\n-Neigh!\n\nAs I cowered before its menacing horn, the unicorn lowered its head further and began rubbing its face against me.\n\n\"......?\"\n\n-Snort!\n\nA soft, warm sensation spread across my cheek.\n\nI couldn't help but twitch at the ticklish feeling.\n\n\"Wh-what's this...? What are you doing?\"\n\nThe unicorn's sudden display of affection, as if it were a well-trained puppy, caught me off guard.\n\nIt ignored my bewilderment and continued to nuzzle me, letting out a happy snort.\n\n\"Uh, um...\"\n\nFlustered, I instinctively reached out and began stroking its back.\n\nWere unicorns usually this affectionate towards humans?\n\nI had only ever read about them in books. Now that I was actually facing one, I had no idea what to do.\n\nConfused, I continued to stroke the unicorn's neck.\n\nIts soft fur felt comforting beneath my hand.\n\nThe unicorn nuzzled my hand and licked it with its warm tongue.\n\nI stared at it blankly for a moment before muttering under my breath.\n\n\"...Cute.\"\n\nIt was like petting a giant white dog.\n\nA smile tugged at the corners of my lips.\n\nAs I continued to pet the creature, my face undoubtedly a mess of emotions, I heard Golden Boy's voice behind me.\n\n\"Woohoo www! Everyone's out there having fun, and you're here all alone, acting like a total loner... Huh?\"\n\nGolden Boy, who had been sauntering towards me, stopped dead in his tracks as he spotted the unicorn beside me.\n\nHe stared at me with an incredulous expression.\n\n\"H-how...!?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"How is there a unicorn...? Wait, don't tell me... you were actually a virgin?!\"\n\nGolden Boy pointed at the unicorn with a trembling finger.\n\nI frowned at him and replied.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you before?\"\n\n\"Dude, I thought you were lying!\"\n\n\"Why don't you believe anything I say...\"\n\nI sighed inwardly, understanding his reaction.\n\nConsidering the rumors that circulated about me at the Academy, it wasn't that surprising.\n\n\"Anyway, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"What else? I came to check on our lonely little maniac Young Master.\"\n\n\"Well, you're here now, so sit down. What are you standing around for?\"\n\n\"Ahaha... about that...\"\n\nGolden Boy chuckled nervously, scratching his head.\n\nHis gaze was fixed on the unicorn beside me.\n\nI smirked and stood up.\n\n\"Come to think of it... you said you were a virgin too, right?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah... why?\"\n\n\"Let's put that to the test, shall we?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about...? W-wait, hey!\"\n\nBefore he could react, I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him closer.\n\nHe struggled against my grip, his eyes wide with panic.\n\nI smiled sweetly and dragged him towards the unicorn.\n\n\"Time for a little truth serum.\"\n\n\"L-let go of me...!!\"\n\nI grabbed Golden Boy's hand and guided it towards the unicorn.\n\nIf he had been lying to me, his hand would be pierced by that horn in an instant.\n\nI grinned at him.\n\n\"Go on, prove your purity.\"\n\nGolden Boy's blue eyes trembled.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Give me a second to prepare myself!\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nMy iron grip finally subdued Golden Boy's struggles.\n\nHe mumbled something under his breath, as if giving up, then sighed deeply.\n\n\"Before I prove my purity... there are two things I need to say.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nWith a solemn expression, Golden Boy held up three fingers.\n\n\"You said two things, but why are three fingers up...?\"\n\n\"First, I am indeed a virgin.\"\n\nGolden Boy cut me off, beginning his declaration.\n\nOne of his three fingers folded down.\n\n\"And second... I've never even had a girlfriend.

Still don't believe me?\"\n\nGolden Boy looked up at me with a triumphant smirk.\n\nI nodded, conceding.\n\n\"Fine, Golden Boy. I believe you.

Young Master Lishite...!!\n\n-Haa, haa... You have a nice body, Amelia.\n\nIt happened around this time last year.\n\nAfter Raiden's sudden transformation into a degenerate, Margaret dedicated herself to his rehabilitation.\n\nShe visited the Lishite Dukedom's mansion every day, making her presence known.\n\nShe went to great lengths to prevent Raiden's outrageous behavior.\n\nIt wasn't easy to support someone while enduring scorn and insults from others, but she refused to give up on him.\n\nBecause she loved him.\n\nEven though he had strayed far from the path, she believed she could bring him back.\n\nBut...\n\nHer devotion was met with a cruel betrayal.\n\n-This is my lady's room...

It was Golden Boy, sitting beside me.\n\nI snapped back to reality and replied, \"...Did you say something?\"\n\n\"You seem out of it. Tired?\"\n\n\"A little, I guess.\"\n\n\"Why don't you get some shut-eye? Violet already turned in a while ago.\"\n\nGolden Boy gestured towards the tents.\n\nI shook my head slowly.\n\n\"I'll sleep later. It's still early.\"\n\n\"Hmm... Alright then.\"\n\nGolden Boy shrugged and turned away.\n\nI stretched slightly and glanced around.\n\nThat's when I realized Margaret, our other group member, was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Where's Lady Phyler? I don't see her around here.\"\n\n\"Lady Phyler? She said she had something to do...\"\n\n\"Why are you looking for me?\"\n\nA cold voice cut Golden Boy off before he could finish.\n\nWe turned around to see Margaret standing behind us, arms crossed, her expression unreadable.\n\nI forced a smile.\n\n\"...We were just wondering where you were since you weren't here.\"\n\n\"It's none of your business.\"\n\nMargaret replied curtly and sat down next to Golden Boy.\n\nGolden Boy started sweating, stammering, \"Um... If you sit there... I-I feel kind of awkward... between the two of you...\"\n\n\"Awkward?\"\n\nMargaret's eyes narrowed at Golden Boy's mumbling.\n\nGolden Boy flinched and shook his head vigorously.\n\n\"N-no! I meant comfortable! Very comfortable!\"\n\n\"Good. I'm glad we understand each other.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nI had to stifle a laugh at Golden Boy's pathetic display.\n\nBut then I remembered that I was in no position to laugh and quickly composed myself.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAn awkward silence descended upon us as Golden Boy and I fell silent.\n\nI snuck a glance at Margaret.\n\nShe was staring intently at the bonfire, her chin resting on her hand.\n\nFor a moment, I thought she might be \"fire-gazing\" like I was earlier, but something about her demeanor seemed different.\n\nHer expression was too serious to be simply lost in thought.\n\nIt was as if she was deep in contemplation, her mind preoccupied with something heavy.\n\nCome to think of it, she had been like this all day.\n\nOr rather, ever since we visited the Garden of Purity.\n\nDid something happen...?\n\nI pondered the question I couldn't bring myself to ask.\n\nThe silence stretched on, and finally, Golden Boy, unable to bear the awkwardness any longer, broke the silence.\n\n\"Hey, Maniac. So, what song are you going to sing?\"\n\n\"Hmm? Sing?\"\n\n\"You know, for that.\"\n\nGolden Boy whispered, subtly gesturing towards something with his chin.\n\nFollowing his gaze, I saw a line of students taking turns singing songs.\n\nAnd the line was headed our way.\n\nI asked, my voice laced with disbelief, \"...Wait, every student has to sing?\"\n\n\"Huh? You didn't know? We're going around the circle.\"\n\nGolden Boy tilted his head, looking at me as if I were the strange one.\n\nI groaned and pinched the bridge of my nose.\n\nSo that's why the guitar kept getting passed around...\n\nEveryone had to sing a song.\n\n\"So, what are you going to sing?\"\n\n\"I'm not singing.\"\n\nI shook my head at Golden Boy, who was looking at me expectantly.\n\nHe nudged me with his elbow, a mischievous glint in his eyes.\n\n\"Come on, don't be a spoilsport~\"\n\n\"It's beneath me as a noble.\"\n\n\"This is a tradition of our esteemed Academy!

Your turn.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nIt seemed I was the last one. Golden Boy, Margaret, and all the other students had already taken their turns.\n\nFor the record, Golden Boy had sung the latest street song popular in the capital.\n\nIt was surprisingly bearable.\n\nGolden Boy, the soulful crooner... what a terrifying thought.\n\nMargaret had chosen a classic, a bit older than Golden Boy's selection.\n\nAs for what she sang... well, to protect the Lady's image, I'll refrain from commenting.\n\n\"You know how to play the guitar, right?\"\n\n\"To some extent.\"\n\n\"So... what are you going to sing?\"\n\n\"What to sing... hmm.\"\n\nI tapped the guitar in my hands thoughtfully at Golden Boy's question.\n\nTo be honest, I had already decided on a song.\n\nThere was only one song I could actually play properly.\n\nAnd it was also the only song I wanted to sing.\n\n\"I've made up my mind.\"\n\n\"What song?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't know it even if I told you.\"\n\nIt was a song from my past life... a modern song.\n\nIt wasn't something the people of this world would be familiar with.\n\nIt was a song my brother, Changho, had introduced me to, and it had become my favorite.\n\nIt was a melody that had helped me through one of the toughest times in my life.\n\nI lightly strummed the guitar strings, starting the intro.\n\nThe familiar vibrations traveled from my fingertips, following the smooth movements of my hand.\n\nAs I set a melancholic mood with the somber melody, my eyes met Margaret's for a fleeting moment.\n\nHer red eyes seemed to hold a mixture of complex emotions.\n\nI gave her an awkward smile and began to sing the first verse.\n\n-The threshold, once crossed, is a dizzying place.\n\n-It is my comfortable boundary line.\n\n-It only confuses my heart, useless emotions I had pushed aside are now covered in dust.\n\n-To leave here is death, the unfamiliar happiness is scarier than the familiar sadness.\n\n-I'm afraid I'll become like my worn-out shoes, abandoned.\n\n-The world, time, and people will all wear me down.\n\nMy voice, accompanied by the melody of the guitar, resonated through the darkness.\n\nThe calm and quiet singing filled the night air, seeping into every nook and cranny.\n\nI didn't rush, letting the notes flow out slowly and deliberately.\n\n-Am I even worthy of happiness?\n\n-Why do I drown myself in even the shallowest of wounds?\n\n-Life may be a barrage of arrows for everyone, but why is the target stuck to my heart so big?\n\nThe chatter of the surrounding students gradually died down.\n\nOne by one, they fell silent, turning their attention towards me.\n\nMy singing created a vacuum of silence, which I then filled with the next verse.\n\n-My emotions swing from one extreme to another.\n\n-I'm left breathless, unable to control my own heart.\n\n-I'm letting go of the world, happiness is just a few steps away, but I keep raising the stairs, one step at a time.\n\nI could feel their gazes upon me.\n\nFrom the sides, from the front, and from behind.\n\nIt felt as if everyone had stopped what they were doing and were now focused solely on me.\n\nUncomfortable with the sudden attention, I closed my eyes.\n\nThe song had reached its climax.\n\n-Now I cry without tears.\n\n-I cry again, as easily as breathing.\n\n-In the sadness that has become my home.\n\n-Even when I try to take a step away, I cry at the threshold.\n\nWith each line I sang, a dull ache spread through my chest.\n\nMy eyes felt hot, as if tears were threatening to spill, and my throat tightened.\n\nI took a shallow breath, trying to calm the overwhelming emotions welling up inside me.\n\nA bittersweet memory from the past flashed through my mind.\n\n-Huh? What am I doing? Oh, just listening to some music.\n\n-Want to hear it?\n\n-It's the song I always listen to when I'm feeling down.\n\nIt was the song Changho had shared with me.\n\nThe only person who had tried to save me from my miserable life, his memory etched into the melody.\n\nEven though he was gone now.\n\nEven though he had lost everything and left this world.\n\nHis presence lingered on within me.\n\n-In the depths of my sadness, which has become my home, I wonder...\n\n-Can I invite you into my sadness, which has become my home?\n\nI fought back the urge to open my eyes, forcing myself to finish the song.\n\nUntil the bitter recollection of loneliness faded away.\n\n***\n\n\"...\"\n\nMargaret sat frozen, her mind reeling.\n\nShe replayed the poignant lyrics in her head, trying to grasp their meaning.\n\n-In the sadness that has become my home.\n\n-Even when I try to take a step away, I cry at the threshold.\n\nThe speaker sought refuge from a world that tormented them, retreating into the familiar embrace of their own sorrow.\n\nIt was a sadness that had become so deeply ingrained that it felt like home.\n\nThe speaker was drowning in their own misery, slowly suffocating in its depths.\n\nThe lyrics were heavy with despair, leaving a profound impact on anyone who listened.\n\nMargaret couldn't help but stare at the boy singing.\n\nHis expression was as impassive as ever, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that he was surrounded by an aura of sadness, as if on the verge of tears.\n\n'...Why?'\n\nWhy did he sing with such a heart-wrenching voice?\n\nWhat sorrow could he possibly harbor to evoke such raw emotion in his song?\n\nMargaret suddenly recalled the moment their eyes had met before he began singing.\n\nThe way he had hesitated for a moment, then offered her a bitter smile.\n\nIt was as if he was pleading with her.\n\nAsking her not to hate him too much.\n\n\"...\"\n\nMargaret bit her lip, her mind a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nThe hatred and contempt that had consumed her heart were now being challenged by a flicker of doubt.\n\nA doubt that grew stronger with each passing moment.\n\nAs the song drew to a close, Margaret couldn't tear her gaze away from Raiden.\n\n***\n\n-Clink... Thud.\n\nAs the last note faded and I placed the guitar on the ground, I realized something was amiss.\n\nThe students, who had been chatting amongst themselves before I started singing, were now staring at me intently, their mouths agape.\n\n\"......?\"\n\nWhat the...? Why were they reacting like this?\n\nWas I that bad?\n\nI shrank back slightly, my eyes darting around nervously.\n\nBut judging by their expressions, it didn't seem like they were put off by my singing.\n\nOn the contrary, they looked... moved.\n\nMost of the students had a glimmer of moisture in their eyes, and some were even sniffling.\n\n\"......\"\n\nDid I do okay...?\n\nI scratched my chin, unsure of how to interpret their reaction.\n\nJust then, a familiar mechanical sound rang out in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Sub Quest Complete!]\n\nTitle: Serenade of the Soul\n\n[Your affinity with the Academy students has increased by 200.]\n\n[You have received 500 points.]\n\n\"So it went well...\"\n\nA wave of relief washed over me as the status window appeared.\n\nI stretched, dismissing the blue screens that had materialized before me.\n\nIt was already past midnight. The bonfire, once bright and cheerful, had dwindled down to a pile of smoldering embers.\n\nI stifled a yawn and rose to my feet, my body heavy with fatigue.\n\nThe other students were also starting to disperse, heading back to their tents.\n\nI was about to follow suit when Margaret brushed past me.\n\n\"......\"\n\nShe glanced at me briefly, her expression unreadable, then turned and walked towards our tent.\n\nI trailed behind her awkwardly.\n\nAs we walked in silence, Golden Boy caught up to us.\n\n\"You guys heading to bed?\" he asked cheerfully.\n\n\"It's late,\" I replied curtly. \"We have activities tomorrow. We need to get some sleep.\"\n\n\"Alright, then I'll turn in too~\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"I bet Violet's already asleep in the tent.\"\n\n\"Probably. She headed back a while ago.\"\n\nWe chatted idly as we walked.\n\nSoon, we reached our tent, a large four-person one.\n\nWe carefully entered, trying not to wake Violet.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the island, lay a vast field.\n\nIt was a place known as the \"Grave of Stars,\" where the knights who had sacrificed their lives in the ancient war against the Demon Realm were laid to rest.\n\nSomething was stirring in the cemetery, amidst the rows upon rows of tombstones.\n\n-Creak... Crack, crumble...\n\nThe earth that blanketed the graves began to shift and convulse, as if alive.\n\nAn eerie black aura pulsed and flickered, enveloping the surroundings in an unsettling glow.\n\nAt the center of this ominous scene stood an old man.\n\nHe was cloaked in black robes, clutching a strange-looking book in his bony hands.\n\nHe stretched out his arms towards the graves, muttering words in an unknown tongue.\n\n\"I summon the souls of the departed, to rise beyond death and sound the bell of chaos...\"\n\nHis voice, raspy and chilling, echoed through the night.\n\nIt was a voice that sounded as if it contained the compressed screams and cries of the entire world.\n\n\"I shall resurrect the flesh of these noble heroes, and they shall feast upon the blood and flesh they are owed...\"\n\nCross the river of death and ascend to the path of eternal slumber.\n\n\"...And my long-held desire shall be fulfilled.\"\n\nAn ominous energy crackled around the old man's hands.\n\nA viscous black liquid dripped from his fingertips, seeping into the graves.\n\nHe opened the book and pricked his finger, letting a single drop of blood fall onto its pages.\n\nThe bloodstain spread and darkened, and the dark auras surrounding the tombstones flared to life, burning with a crimson light.\n\nThe old man gazed upon the scene and whispered, \"Oh, great Demon King, Lugetina Tov Di Atrahasis. In the name of your third disciple, the Four Heavenly Kings' Pyren, I command you...\"\n\nRise, my knights.\n\n-Crack!!\n\nAs he uttered the final word, a hand burst forth from the ground.\n\n-Clatter, crack! Clatter!\n\nMore hands followed, clawing their way out of their earthen prisons.\n\nThe warriors who had fought valiantly against the demons a thousand years ago were being resurrected as death knights.\n\n\"You will make fine sacrifices before the Demon King's return...\"\n\nThe old man chuckled, looking down at the dozens of undead kneeling before him.\n\n\"Master, your command?\"\n\nThe death knight at the front of the group bowed its head and spoke.\n\nPyren's eyes gleamed with malice as he issued his order.\n\n\"Kill every living being on this island.\"\n\n\"As you command.\"\n\nThe knights drew their weapons in unison.\n\nPyren let out another chilling laugh and muttered to himself, \"My King... the day we welcome your return draws near.\"\n\nAnd with that, the old man vanished.\n\nAll that remained was an army of death, ready to carry out their master's orders.\n\n-Clank, clank...\n\nThe death knights marched forward, their heavy footsteps echoing through the night.\n\nTheir destination: the base camp of Reynolds Academy.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Bonus chapter thanks to '@HarvestedSoul' for subscription to 'Sorrow' tier  on Ko-fi.Tragedy always\n\nAfter roughly organizing our sleeping arrangements, we headed to the showers located near the base camp to wash up.\n\nAs I soaked my fatigue-ridden body in the hot water, I could feel the tension in my muscles gradually easing away.\n\n\"Wow~ These facilities are great~\"\n\n\"Yeah, not bad at all.\"\n\nGolden Boy and I mumbled to each other as we stepped out of the showers.\n\nFor a temporary facility on an island, it was unbelievably clean and luxurious.\n\nI heard they were built directly by the Academy for these field trips...\n\nNo matter how I looked at it, it felt like a colossal waste of money.\n\nWhy would they build showers just for a few field trips a year?\n\nI shook my head in disbelief at the Academy's lavish spending as we returned to our tent.\n\n\"So, how are we going to handle the night watch?\"\n\n\"Night watch?\"\n\nGolden Boy asked as I sat down on my sleeping bag to finish drying my hair.\n\nI frowned at his question.\n\n\"Night watch...? We have to do that...?\"\n\n\"Yeah, apparently. It's another one of the Academy's~ long-standing traditions~!\"\n\n\"They really go all out...\"\n\n\"Honestly, I agree.\"\n\nGolden Boy chuckled and then flopped onto a sleeping bag.\n\nWait, why was he on mine?\n\nI kicked him off, reclaiming my space.\n\n\"Ouch! Hey!\"\n\n\"Get off my sleeping bag.\"\n\n\"Ow, ow, ow!\"\n\n\"Shh, everyone be quiet. Miss Violet is sleeping.\"\n\nGolden Boy's yelps were cut short by a reprimand from Margaret.\n\nHe pouted, looking thoroughly chastised.\n\n\"...Look what you did, you got me in trouble.\"\n\nWhat was he even talking about?\n\nI lightly smacked him upside the head, just to drive the point home.\n\n-Thwack!\n\n\"Ouch!! You hit me again!\"\n\n\"Mr. Boy! Quiet down!\"\n\n\"Hmph...\"\n\nAh, refreshing.\n\nI shot Golden Boy a smirk as he glared at me.\n\n\"Ugh... you're such a...\" he started, then trailed off, unable to come up with a suitable insult. He eventually flopped onto his own sleeping bag in defeat.\n\n\"Seriously... jerk...\"\n\n\"Let me remind you, you're the only one who would dare speak to the Duke's eldest son like that.\"\n\n\"So what? Our Maniac~ isn't the type to hold a grudge~\"\n\n\"Well, I'd watch your back at night if I were you.\"\n\n\"Ooh, scary.\"\n\nGolden Boy chuckled at my empty threat, rolling over onto his side.\n\nHe burrowed into his sleeping bag, only his head peeking out.\n\n\"So, about the night watch...\"\n\n\"With just the three of us, does the order really matter?\"\n\n\"Three...? There are four of us in our group.\"\n\n\"You planning on waking her up?\"\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nGolden Boy followed my gaze to where Violet lay fast asleep in the corner of the tent. He nodded in understanding.\n\n\"Yeah, I don't think I could wake her up either... I feel like she'd start crying...\"\n\n\"She probably would.\"\n\nViolet, curled up like a wet kitten, looked so pitiful that the thought of waking her was simply unbearable.\n\nI glanced at the sleeping girl, her chest rising and falling with each peaceful breath, before turning my attention to Margaret.\n\n\"What are your thoughts, Lady Maharet?\"\n\n\"...I don't mind any order.\"\n\nOh, she answered.\n\nHonestly, I thought she'd ignore me.\n\nMaybe it was the effect of the increased affinity I'd received as a quest reward earlier.\n\nGood thing I decided to do that sub-quest.\n\nA small sense of accomplishment washed over me, and I allowed a faint smile to touch my lips.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWe decided on the order for the night watch: me, Golden Boy, then Margaret.\n\nGolden Boy, stuck in the middle, had complained about getting the short end of the stick.\n\nA few well-aimed flicks to the forehead had quickly shut him up.\n\nThe nerve of this guy, complaining about the order we fairly decided with rock-paper-scissors.\n\nEspecially after suggesting it himself.\n\n\"......\"\n\nAnd so, I found myself sitting outside the tent, staring blankly into the fire, as the first one up for the seemingly pointless night watch.\n\nA small bonfire crackled merrily in front of me, casting a warm glow on the surrounding area.\n\nUnlike the grand bonfire from earlier, this one was small and cozy.\n\nI tossed a few more logs onto the flames, ensuring that my little companion wouldn't die out anytime soon.\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nMy breath formed a faint cloud in the cool night air.\n\nAutumn had arrived, bringing with it a chill that forced me to pull my jacket tighter around myself.\n\nA gentle breeze rustled the leaves overhead, and a single red leaf, its vibrant color now faded with age, detached itself from a nearby branch and drifted down towards me.\n\n-Rustle...\n\nI watched silently as it landed on the ground at my feet.\n\nThe wind and the falling leaves.\n\nI was caught in the midst of autumn's melancholic embrace.\n\nAs I sat there, lost in my thoughts, a sobering realization hit me.\n\n\"...Why am I not asleep?\"\n\nI had planned to pretend to stay awake for the night watch while secretly catching up on some much-needed sleep.\n\nBut for some reason, I was wide awake.\n\nI tried to deny it, but the reality was harsh and unforgiving.\n\nInsomnia had once again reared its ugly head.\n\n\"Damn it.\"\n\nI cursed under my breath, running my hand through my hair in frustration.\n\nHow many nights in a row had it been now...?\n\nI hadn't slept a wink last night either. This was getting ridiculous...\n\nAs my silent lament continued, I felt myself drifting further and further away from the realm of sleep.\n\nI wouldn't be able to sleep much anyway with the night watch and all.\n\nMaybe after my shift, I could lie down and toss and turn for a bit... maybe I'd be lucky enough to squeeze in an hour or two of sleep.\n\nI sighed heavily, my head pounding.\n\nIt was my own fault, really.\n\nI should have gotten my hands on some sleeping pills beforehand.\n\n\"Ugh... what am I even doing...?\"\n\nI chuckled wryly, my lips twisting into a self-deprecating smile.\n\nI scratched the back of my head and muttered, \"Well... I guess I might as well finish my watch.\"\n\nThere was no point in even trying to sleep at this point.\n\nI might as well just keep watch alone.\n\nMargaret and Golden Boy both looked exhausted after today's activities.\n\nBesides, I felt a pang of guilt at the thought of waking up Margaret.\n\n\"...Damn it.\"\n\nI fished a Deathweed cigarette out of my pocket, my mind heavy with a strange mix of frustration and resignation.\n\nAs I flicked my magic lighter and brought the flame to the tip of the cigarette, a thought crossed my mind.\n\nIt was going to be a long, lonely night.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, at the professors' temporary lodgings located a short distance from the base camp...\n\n\"...Something feels off.\"\n\nLucas, the homeroom professor of Raphael Class, suddenly sat up in his sleeping bag and muttered, a hint of unease in his voice.\n\n\"What is it? What's wrong, Lucas?\"\n\nAaron, the homeroom professor of Ariel Class, who had been sleeping soundly beside him, stirred and looked over.\n\nHe yawned widely, his face creased with fatigue.\n\n\"What's gotten you so worked up...? Did something happen?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"......Lucas?\"\n\nLucas remained silent, his eyes closed as if deep in thought.\n\nHe finally opened his eyes, a frown etched on his face.\n\n\"Something doesn't feel right... It's just a hunch, but something feels very wrong.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you've sensed some strange presence? Like those assassins from last time...\"\n\n\"......No, it's not that.\"\n\n\"Phew... Good to know nothing's actually happened.\"\n\nAaron let out a sigh of relief at Lucas's firm denial.\n\nHowever, Lucas's expression remained tense.\n\nHis gut feeling was screaming at him that something was amiss.\n\nIt was as if he had sensed a lurking danger, a threat hidden from plain sight.\n\nA voice whispered in the back of his mind, warning him of an ominous and terrifying future.\n\n\"......\"\n\nBut what was it...? What was coming their way...?\n\nThe flow of mana felt normal, and the barriers they had erected around the island were all functioning properly.\n\nThey had thoroughly investigated the island beforehand and confirmed that there were no immediate threats.\n\n\"...Maybe it's nothing.\"\n\nLucas had to admit that his intuition wasn't always accurate.\n\nIt had been nearly a decade since he had retired from active duty, and his senses weren't as sharp as they used to be.\n\nBoth Aron and Lucas knew that this could be another one of those false alarms.\n\n\"Come on, Lucas. Let's get some rest. We have to be up early tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nAron lay back down, his face relaxed as the tension drained away.\n\nLucas hesitated for a moment before letting out a sigh.\n\n\"Alright... I'm just going to take a quick walk around the island.\"\n\n\"...Are you serious?\"\n\nLucas forced a smile at Aron's exasperated expression.\n\nHe grabbed his jacket and discreetly slipped a few daggers and threw knives into his sleeves.\n\n\"You know I can't help it. I can't just ignore this feeling. It's bothering me.\"\n\n\"Ugh... I know, I know. This isn't the first time you've pulled this.\"\n\n\"Well, old habits die hard... Especially those you pick up on the battlefield.\"\n\n\"That's why I don't even bother nagging you anymore.\"\n\nLucas chuckled at Aron's grumbling.\n\n\"Professor Aron... I hate to break it to you, but I'm the head instructor here. Technically, I'm your superior.\"\n\n\"My nagging transcends such trivial matters as rank and authority.\"\n\n\"I see... Now I understand why Professor Sharon and Professor Kate never miss an opportunity to tease you about your bald spot.\"\n\n\"Hey!! That's hitting below the belt!\"\n\nLucas laughed out loud at Aron's outburst.\n\nHe finished his preparations and headed towards the tent flap.\n\n\"Well, I'm off.\"\n\n\"Want me to come with you?\"\n\n\"It's alright. You get some rest.\"\n\n\"Be careful out there... The Headmistress will have our hides if anything happens to you.\"\n\n\"Hahaha! I wouldn't want to disappoint my master!\"\n\n\"Be back before lunch. You need to eat.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n-Fwoosh!\n\nWith a final word, Lucas vanished in a flash of light.\n\nAron watched him go, a hint of worry in his eyes, before settling back down.\n\nLittle did they know that this would be the last time they would see each other alive.\n\nA few hours later...\n\nLucas's headless body would be found lying cold and lifeless on the ground.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Clash! Thud! Crack!!\n\nThe sounds of metal clashing against metal echoed through the chilly night air.\n\nLucas, the homeroom professor of Raphael Class, was locked in a fierce battle against a group of unidentified undead knights.\n\nHe wielded a dagger in each hand, his movements swift and precise as he parried their attacks.\n\n-Screech...! Boom!!\n\nThe tranquil pre-dawn atmosphere was shattered by the sounds of their violent struggle.\n\nLucas dodged a volley of arrows, his breathing ragged as he fought to keep the monstrous creatures at bay.\n\nThey lunged at him relentlessly, their eyes burning with an unholy light.\n\nThere was no time to rest, no time to catch his breath.\n\n\"Reflect!!\"\n\nHe chanted a spell, and the arrows that had been hurtling toward him changed direction, flying back toward their attackers.\n\n-Thud, thud!\n\nThe arrows pierced the heads of the undead knights at the front of the group, sending them crashing to the ground.\n\nLucas seized the opportunity, launching a counterattack before they could regroup.\n\nHe channeled his mana into his daggers, the blades glowing with a blue light.\n\nThe magic surged through him, merging with his physical attacks.\n\nHe combined two elements, creating a new type of strike.\n\nLight.\n\nAnd Ignite.\n\nThe seventh Purification spell, a powerful combination of intermediate-level magic.\n\n\"Supernova Explosion!\"\n\n-Boooom!!!\n\nHe swung his glowing daggers, unleashing a wave of explosive energy that engulfed the knights.\n\nThe undead creatures screamed as the purifying light burned their flesh, their bodies dissolving into dust.\n\n\"Gasp... Gasp...\"\n\nLucas stumbled back, his chest heaving.\n\nThe remaining knights paused, seemingly stunned by his display of power, and took a moment to regroup.\n\nHe tried to contact the camp using his emergency communication device, but...\n\n-Click, click, click...\n\nThere was no signal.\n\nHe threw the useless device to the ground in frustration.\n\nHe gripped his daggers tighter, his face grim.\n\n\"This is... not good.\"\n\nHis premonition had been right after all.\n\nHe had been scouting the island, checking the perimeter, and this was the last place he had visited before heading back to camp.\n\n\"What are these things...?\"\n\nHe had sensed no disturbances in the flow of mana, no demonic energy.\n\nAnd yet, here they were.\n\nUndead creatures with no detectable demonic aura.\n\nHe couldn't even begin to imagine what kind of monstrous being could have created such abominations.\n\n-Clank, clank...\n\nThe undead knights advanced once more, their movements slow but relentless.\n\nLucas chuckled dryly, wiping the sweat from his brow.\n\n\"At least... they're manageable.\"\n\nThe situation was far from ideal.\n\nHe had only brought light gear for a simple scouting mission, and his equipment was insufficient for a prolonged battle.\n\nHe had also injured his leg in the initial attack, making escape impossible.\n\nAnd his mana reserves were running dangerously low.\n\nBut Lucas was a professor at the Academy.\n\nThe head instructor, no less, at the most prestigious educational institution in the entire continent.\n\nDespite the unfavorable circumstances, he was slowly gaining the upper hand.\n\n'There were eighty-seven of them initially...

Please, don't disappoint me, young man.\"\n\nThe old man leaped back, widening the distance between them, and spoke with a relaxed expression, provoking Lucas.\n\nLucas accepted the challenge, gathering mana in both hands.\n\n\"Stars, heed my call.\"\n\nAs if responding to Lucas's invocation, a brilliant white light erupted from his fingertips.\n\nLucas swayed for a moment, feeling a wave of dizziness as he commanded the flowing starlight.\n\n\"One last time… Lend me your strength.\"\n\nIt was a forbidden magic.\n\nA technique that traded the caster's lifespan for a brief moment of ultimate purification - the Reversion of Radiance.\n\nLucas was about to unleash the technique he had vowed never to use again after the war.\n\n-Lucas… Please, do this one thing for your master.\n\n-Promise me, that no matter what happens, you will never use that magic again.\n\n-Your lifespan… it's already so short… Please, for your own sake, you need to live.\n\n-Please… I don't want to lose you too.\n\nHis lover's sorrowful voice echoed in his ears.\n\nA bitter feeling welled up within him, reflected in his emerald eyes.\n\nLucas bid farewell in his heart, a message he could never convey.\n\n\"I offer all of my remaining lifespan… Two years and four months.\"\n\nI'm sorry, Master.\n\nIt seems your unworthy disciple will be leaving first.\n\nI broke my promise and ended up taking my own life, but I have no regrets.\n\nI would gladly give my life a thousand times over to protect the students I swore to guide, the students I saved from a blood-soaked battlefield.\n\n…If there's one regret I have…\n\n-What? You want me to say that…?\n\n-No, it's not that I can't…! It's just embarrassing…!\n\n-Alright, alright! I'll say it, so stop whining!\n\n-…I… I love you, Lucas.\n\n…It would be that I couldn't see your face one last time before I depart.\n\nPlease, don't grieve for me too long.\n\nAnd, please… look after the students for me.\n\n\"Bloom, Flower of Life.\"\n\n-Lucas Style Annihilation Magic Secret Technique-\n\n'Full Bloom.'\n\nPure white flowers blossomed in the air.\n\nOne by one, two by two, they burst open in succession…\n\nUntil they covered the entire clearing, transforming it into a vast field of white.\n\nThe old man and the young man stood facing each other amidst the beautiful field of swirling flower petals.\n\n\"A magic that sacrifices lifespan… Beautiful, yet undeniably cruel.\"\n\n\"Gasp… Gasp…\"\n\n\"A beautiful death… How ironic, don't you think, young man?\"\n\n\"Cough, hack… Shut… up… and… come… get… me…\"\n\n\"Heh heh… Very well. Let's put you out of your misery.\"\n\nThe old man lunged towards the gasping Lucas with a light chuckle.\n\nAt the same time, Lucas kicked off the ground.\n\nAnd in the next instant…\n\n-BEEEEEP!!!\n\nA blinding white flash and a jet-black blade clashed, and a deafening ringing sound, as if the forest itself was screaming, filled the air.\n\n***\n\n“Take it off. Right here, right now.”\n\n“Huh…?”\n\nViolet stared at me blankly, as if trying to decipher the meaning behind my nonchalant words.\n\n“R-right here…?”\n\n“Yes, right here, in front of me.”\n\nI confirmed, nodding my head, and watched as the color drained from her face.\n\nShe instinctively raised her hand to cover her bandaged face, her voice trembling as she protested.\n\n“N-no! I can’t…”\n\nShe pulled her knees up to her chest, curling into herself like a frightened turtle retreating into its shell.\n\nHer fingers clutched at the fabric of her clothes as she trembled.\n\n“I-I can’t show you… what’s under this bandage…!”\n\n“And why not?”\n\nI had clearly struck a nerve. Violet’s reaction was more intense than I had anticipated.\n\nI knew the reason behind her fear, but I pressed on, feigning ignorance.\n\n“Now that I think about it, I’m curious. Why do you wear that bandage anyway?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Hoh, are you choosing to ignore me, commoner?”\n\n“Eek…!”\n\nViolet flinched at my threatening tone, her head snapping down in a gesture of submission.\n\n“Th-that’s not it…! I-it’s just like I said before… what’s under this bandage… i-it’s… really ugly…”\n\n“…Ugly?”\n\n“P-people… they say it’s disgusting… they told me to… t-to keep it covered…”\n\n“...”\n\nI gritted my teeth, her words stinging more than I had expected.\n\nI already knew what lay beneath the bandages, but hearing her say it out loud, hearing the pain and shame in her voice, it filled me with a rage I could barely contain.\n\nDisgusting? Keep it covered?\n\nIf hearing those words secondhand was enough to make me ache with sympathy, what must it have been like for Violet to hear them said to her face, day after day?\n\nI took a deep breath, composing myself before speaking again.\n\n“Take off the bandage. I don’t care about such things.”\n\n“…”\n\nViolet stared at me with a mixture of fear and disbelief.\n\nShe probably expected me to recoil in disgust, just like everyone else.\n\nI could see the fear in her eyes, and for a moment, I almost relented.\n\nBut I couldn’t back down now.\n\n“You’re making me even more curious about what’s under there.”\n\n“B-but… I… I can’t…”\n\nHer voice was barely a whisper, tears welling up in her beautiful violet eyes.\n\nI steeled my expression, adopting a cold and indifferent demeanor.\n\n“Don’t talk back to me, commoner. You’re forgetting your place in front of the Lishite family.”\n\n“Eek…! N-no, that’s not…!”\n\nIt was a low blow, a blatant abuse of my authority.\n\nShe had no obligation to show me anything.\n\nI was being selfish, driven by a morbid curiosity to see the scars that I had only read about, to understand the depths of her pain.\n\n“Just do it. I won’t ask again.”\n\n“H-hic… Y-yes… S-sniff…”\n\n“...”\n\n“I-I’ll show you… J-just… please…”\n\n-Rustle…\n\nTears streamed down her face as she reached up with trembling fingers and began to unwind the bandage.\n\nSlowly, agonizingly, the veil that hid her face was lifted.\n\nThe white cloth fell away, revealing…\n\n“...”\n\n“S-sob… D-don’t… Don’t look…”\n\nA large, discolored scar that covered the entire right side of her face.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Don’t… Don’t look…!”\n\nShe tried to cover her face with her other hand, but it was no use.\n\nShe knew, from experience, that people changed when they saw her scar.\n\nHer voice was a desperate plea.\n\n“P-please… Don’t… Don’t kill me… I-I’m sorry… I’m sorry for being so disgusting… I-I’ll disappear… I’ll never let you see me again…”\n\nHer words, the way she begged for her life, the tears that streamed down her face…\n\nIt was heartbreaking.\n\nIt was a sharp, piercing pain in my chest, stealing my breath.\n\nImages from the original story, scenes from Violet’s life, flashed through my mind.\n\n-I… I should never have been born.\n\nA young girl, the sole survivor of a burning village.\n\nScarred, cursed, destined to be alone.\n\nShe eventually succumbed to the darkness, unable to bear the weight of her loneliness.\n\n-I… I just wanted to be loved… like you…\n\nHer final words, spoken with a bloodstained smile as Allen’s blade pierced her heart.\n\nThe image of her collapsing, her body dissolving into dust, was seared into my memory.\n\nIt was a story I could never forget, a story that filled me with unbearable sadness.\n\n-Sniff… Sniff…\n\nI felt tears pricking at my own eyes as I remembered how I had felt reading those words, sitting alone in my room.\n\nViolet noticed my tears and stared at me with wide, surprised eyes.\n\n\"Y-young Master…?\"\n\nI blinked back the tears, the memories still fresh in my mind.\n\nI slowly reached out, my hand moving towards her scarred cheek.\n\nMy fingers gently touched the discolored skin, the rough, uneven texture a stark contrast to the smooth skin of her other cheek.\n\nBut it wasn't disgusting. It wasn't repulsive.\n\nAll I felt was a deep, overwhelming surge of empathy.\n\n“Ah…?”\n\nViolet flinched, squeezing her eyes shut, bracing herself for a blow that never came.\n\nShe slowly opened her eyes, her gaze meeting mine.\n\nThose beautiful violet eyes, filled with a lifetime of pain and sadness…\n\n“It must have hurt…”\n\nI spoke softly, my voice barely a whisper, as I gently caressed her cheek.\n\n“...And lonely.”\n\nHow many people had turned away from her in disgust? How many times had she been told to hide her face, to disappear?\n\nA life lived in the shadows, burdened by a curse she didn’t deserve…\n\nJust like me, in my past life.\n\nHad she cried herself to sleep every night, just like I had?\n\n\"Ah… uh…\"\n\nViolet let out a small, confused sound, her expression a mixture of shock and disbelief.\n\n\"Young Master…?

You're not disgusting at all.\"\n\n\"Ah…\"\n\nHer face contorted in a series of expressions – confusion, disbelief, hope, fear…\n\nShe didn't know what to do, what to say, how to react.\n\nFinally, she just broke down, tears streaming down her face once more.\n\nIt was a raw, instinctive reaction, like a dam bursting after years of holding back a torrent of emotions.\n\n\"You're crying.\"\n\nI said softly, wiping away the tears that rolled down her cheek.\n\nShe seemed to realize she was crying, her hand flying up to cover her face.\n\n\"Ah… I-I’m sorry…! W-why am I…?”\n\nShe apologized, but instead of pulling away from my touch, she leaned into it.\n\nI felt the slightest bit of pressure against my hand, a silent plea for comfort.\n\nShe might not have been aware of it, but she was seeking solace in my touch.\n\nLike someone who had been lost in the desert for days, finally finding an oasis.\n\n'…She must have craved human touch for so long…’\n\nI extended my other arm, gently pulling her closer.\n\nAnd then, I just sat there, holding her close, letting her cry on my shoulder.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-Whoosh…\n\nThe gentle night breeze rustled the leaves of the surrounding trees, their branches swaying gracefully in the wind.\n\nThe only sounds were the chirping of crickets and the soft rustling of leaves.\n\nDawn was still a long way off.\n\nEveryone else was sound asleep in their tents, lost in their dreams.\n\nI sat by the campfire, watching the flames dance and flicker.\n\n-Crackle… Crackle…\n\nThe fire was still going strong, providing a comforting warmth against the cool night air.\n\nThe flames painted the darkness with a warm, orange glow, casting dancing shadows on the surrounding trees.\n\n-Sniffle… Sniffle…\n\nI was lost in thought when I heard a soft sound coming from beside me.\n\nViolet was slumped against me, her head resting on my shoulder, fast asleep.\n\nShe must have cried herself to sleep.\n\n'She'll get a stiff neck sleeping like that…’\n\nI carefully reached out and lifted her head, gently placing it on my lap.\n\nThat would be more comfortable.\n\n“Mmm… Uh…”\n\nShe frowned in her sleep as if she were having a bad dream.\n\nI gently stroked her cheek, just like I had done before.\n\n“Mmm…”\n\nShe relaxed under my touch, the frown disappearing from her face, replaced by a small, peaceful smile.\n\nI continued to stroke her cheek, my fingers tracing the outline of her scar.\n\n“You fell asleep without putting your bandage back on…”\n\nWhat if someone sees her like this…?\n\nI sighed and picked up the discarded bandage from where it lay on the ground beside us.\n\nI carefully held it up to her face and began to wrap it around her head, covering the scar once more.\n\n-Smooth… Smooth…\n\nI tried my best to be gentle, to avoid waking her.\n\nIt wasn’t the neatest bandage job in the world, but it would have to do.\n\nI smiled to myself, feeling a strange sense of accomplishment.\n\nI carefully lifted her into my arms and carried her back to her tent.\n\nShe would catch a cold if she stayed out here all night.\n\nI gently laid her down on her sleeping bag and stepped back outside.\n\nThe cool night air hit me like a wave, ruffling my hair.\n\nMy dark bangs fell over my eyes, momentarily obscuring my vision.\n\nI brushed them aside and looked up at the sky.\n\nThe stars were out in full force, millions of tiny pinpricks of light scattered across the vast canvas of the night sky.\n\nI sat down again, leaning back against a nearby tree, and gazed up at the breathtaking sight.\n\n“This school trip has been… eventful, to say the least.”\n\nI let out a sigh, but it wasn’t entirely a complaint.\n\nIt had been… nice.\n\nRelaxing, at times. Exciting, at others.\n\nIt had been a welcome change from my usual routine.\n\n'I hope… I hope nothing else goes wrong.’\n\nI closed my eyes and made a silent wish on the stars.\n\nOf course, it wouldn’t be long before that wish was shattered into a million pieces.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Why didn’t you wake me up for my shift?!”\n\nGolden Boy stormed out of the tent before Margaret could finish her question.\n\nI mentally gave him a thumbs-up.\n\nGood timing, Golden Boy.\n\nThe last thing I needed was another round of questions when I was this exhausted.\n\nGolden Boy’s eyes, still clouded with sleep, landed on me, and his face mirrored Margaret’s previous astonishment.\n\n“No way… You took the entire watch shift by yourself?”\n\n“It just… happened.”\n\n“Man… I’m so sorry! Thanks to you, I slept like a log.”\n\nGolden Boy scratched his messy bed hair sheepishly.\n\nI waved my hand dismissively, not really caring for his gratitude.\n\n“Just go wake up Violet.

I won’t kill you. Instead…\n\n-I will give you a fate worse than death.\n\nThe day her life had changed forever.\n\nThe day she had lost everything in a fire, the day she had been cursed by a monstrous being.\n\n“...”\n\nThe curse was absolute, or so she had always believed.\n\nEveryone who had seen her scar had succumbed to its effects.\n\nSome more subtly than others, but they all ended up loathing her.\n\nThat was how it always was.\n\nOr at least, that was how it should have been…\n\n-It's alright… I'm alright.\n\n-...Not at all. You're not disgusting at all.\n\nThe boy in her dream was different.\n\nHe had looked at her scar, had touched it, and yet… he hadn’t recoiled in disgust.\n\nHe hadn't shown even a hint of revulsion.\n\nHe had caressed her cheek with a tenderness she had never known, his touch radiating a comforting warmth that spread through her entire body.\n\nViolet had leaned into his touch, drawn to it like a moth to a flame.\n\nHis warmth chased away the chill that had settled deep within her bones.\n\nShe had been so overwhelmed by the unfamiliar sensation, by the feeling of human contact after years of loneliness, that she had burst into tears.\n\nShe didn't know why she was crying.\n\nShe couldn't control the torrent of emotions that surged through her.\n\nThe warmth of his touch, the first she had felt since her family had perished in the fire since she had been cursed…\n\nIt was too much for her to bear.\n\nShe had clung to his hand, desperately seeking comfort in his touch.\n\nAnd he had stayed with her, holding her close, until her tears had subsided and she had drifted off to sleep.\n\n“...”\n\nIt had to be a dream, she had thought.\n\nIt was too good to be true, too unreal.\n\nJust a fleeting glimpse of a life she could never have.\n\n…That was, until a booming voice shattered the illusion.\n\n“RISE AND SHIIIIIINE!!!!”\n\n“Eek?!”\n\nThe sudden shout jolted her awake.\n\nViolet sat up with a gasp, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\n“Uh… uh…?”\n\n“Come on, sleepyhead. Rise and shine!”\n\nHer vision cleared, and she saw a boy with messy blond hair grinning down at her.\n\nIt was Golden Boy, one of her classmates.\n\n“…Couldn’t you wake me up a little more… gently…?”\n\n“This is the only way that works!”\n\nGolden Boy chuckled, and Violet caught a glimpse of another boy standing behind him.\n\nHe was walking towards them, his expression unreadable.\n\n“You’re finally awake.”\n\n“…”\n\nViolet’s breath hitched in her throat as she recognized the boy from her dream.\n\nRaiden Lishite.\n\n“You fell asleep in that chair last night. I moved you to your tent…”\n\n“Wait, you were awake last night, Violet?”\n\n“Yeah, she came out for a bit at dawn.”\n\n“Whoa, a commoner having a private audience with the Duke’s son… How terrifying.”\n\n“Shut up.”\n\nViolet stared at them, her mind racing.\n\nA private audience with Raiden Lishite…?\n\nBut that had been a dream…?\n\n“W-was it… a dream…?”\n\n“A dream…? What are you talking about?”\n\n“N-nothing!”\n\nRaiden frowned at her, his eyes filled with concern.\n\nViolet waved her hands dismissively, her cheeks flushing red.\n\n“Hmph, if you say so.”\n\nHe didn’t press the matter further, much to her relief.\n\nAs she tried to calm her racing heart, Raiden spoke again.\n\n“Come on, get up. It’s almost time to gather.”\n\n“…”\n\nHis gaze lingered on her bandages for a moment, and Violet felt a jolt run through her body.\n\nShe knew he wasn’t looking at the bandages themselves, but at what lay beneath.\n\nAt the cursed scar hidden beneath the white cloth.\n\n…He knew.\n\nThe realization hit her like a bolt of lightning.\n\nThe events of last night hadn’t been a dream.\n\nThe way she had broken down in front of him, clinging to him like a child… it had all been real.\n\nBut instead of feeling happy that there was someone who wasn’t affected by her curse, all she felt was a wave of shame.\n\n“….!!”\n\nHer cheeks burned with embarrassment.\n\n“What’s gotten into you…?”\n\n“Don’t mind her.”\n\nGolden Boy and Raiden exchanged amused glances, leaving Violet to wallow in her own mortification.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, back on the other side of the island…\n\nThe sounds of battle had long since faded, replaced by an eerie silence.\n\nThe clearing was a scene of utter devastation.\n\nTrees were uprooted, the ground littered with debris, and the air thick with smoke.\n\nIt looked as if a natural disaster had swept through the forest.\n\n“Well… Morning has arrived.”\n\nThe old man stood in the middle of the ravaged clearing, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nHis clothes were covered in dirt and ash.\n\nHe brushed off the dust with a disinterested air and looked around at his surroundings.\n\nTwenty or so black knights were kneeling before him, awaiting his orders.\n\n“Heh heh… That took longer than I expected. These youngsters these days are quite resilient, aren’t they?”\n\n“Master, are we returning now?” One of the knights asked, his voice muffled by his helmet.\n\n“Yes, we can’t stay here any longer. The restrictions are starting to take effect.”\n\nThe old man held up his hand, his fingers slowly crumbling into dust.\n\nHe tossed something he had been holding to one of the knights, a hint of regret in his voice.\n\n“I would have liked to have some fun with those students, but that young man took up too much of my time… Still, I suppose it was entertaining enough.”\n\n“And the orders you gave us…?”\n\n“Carry them out as planned. I don’t expect you to kill them all with your remaining forces, but do try to cause as much chaos and destruction as possible.”\n\n“Yes, Master.”\n\nThe old man didn’t wait for a reply. He turned and disappeared in a swirl of his dark robe.\n\nThe knight stared at the spot where his master had been standing, then drew his sword.\n\nThe other knights followed suit, drawing their weapons.\n\n“Time to deliver death, soldiers.”\n\nThe knight who seemed to be their leader lifted the object the old man had given him and attached it to the tip of his spear.\n\nIt was…\n\nProfessor Lucas’s severed head, its eyes staring blankly into the void.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

The island was full of interesting sights, so it wasn't boring.\n\nPlus, we were each given a portable magical device for emergencies.\n\nSo no, I had no reason to complain.\n\nExcept for the fact that the professors were back at camp, relaxing while we did all the work.\n\nEspecially professors like Sharon and Kate, who usually gave out a ton of assignments.\n\n‘Damn it, someday I’m going to flip this Academy upside down.’\n\nWith the power vested in my family, I would liberate all students suffering from the tyranny of homework.\n\n‘Well, except for Lucas. He’s alright.’\n\nHis workload was reasonable, and his classes weren't too difficult.\n\n‘Someday…’\n\nI was burning with the righteous fury of a revolutionary, ready to overthrow the Academy’s oppressive regime, when Golden Boy, who was walking ahead of me, suddenly spoke.\n\n“Hey, do you even know where we’re going? We’re pretty deep in now…”\n\nHe pulled out a map from his pocket and tried to get his bearings.\n\nOf course, being the idiot that he was, he was holding the map upside down.\n\nAs I was about to sigh and correct him, Margaret, who was walking next to me, spoke up.\n\n“We’re heading to the ‘Grave of Stars’, it’s at the edge of the island.”\n\n“Grave of Stars? Let me see… Grave of Stars…”\n\nGolden Boy’s eyes scanned the map, his eyebrows shooting up in surprise.\n\n“Whoa… It’s all the way on the other side of the island?”\n\n“Yeah, it seems to be connected to the canyon nearby.”\n\n‘The other side of the island?’\n\nI knew this island was huge, but walking all the way there?\n\nWe were going to die of exhaustion before we even got close.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nI groaned inwardly at the thought of the long journey ahead. I fished out a Deathweed from my pocket, desperate for a distraction from my sleep-deprived misery.\n\nAs I lit the herb and inhaled the strangely addictive aroma, I felt a gaze on me.\n\nMargaret, who had been looking at the map with Golden Boy, was now staring at me with a hesitant expression.\n\n“Are you… alright?” she asked.\n\n“Are you… asking me?” I replied, raising an eyebrow.\n\n“Well, who else here would be tired?”\n\n“Don’t worry about me. It’s not like we’re doing anything too strenuous.”\n\n“Well… since it’s a long way, we’ll be riding horses later.”\n\n“That’s good news.”\n\nMargaret gave me a strange look at my nonchalant response before turning away and continuing down the path.\n\nI followed, my eyes trailing after her shimmering silver hair as it swayed with each step.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Reynolds Academy base camp…\n\nThree figures lay sprawled out inside the staff tent.\n\nAron, Kate, and Sharon.\n\nThey were the homeroom professors for Liel, Xenon, and Serina’s classes, respectively.\n\n“Haaam… Aron… where’s Lucas…?” Kate mumbled, yawning loudly.\n\nAron, who had been meditating, opened his eyes and shot her a tired glare.\n\n“How many times do I have to tell you? He’s out scouting.”\n\n“Ugh… but what about lunch duty…? He’s the one who’s supposed to cook…”\n\n“You can cook, can’t you?”\n\n“But… Lucas’s cooking is way better…”\n\n“Well, she’s not wrong about that,” Sharon chimed in.\n\nThey had all skipped breakfast to supervise the students earlier, and their stomachs were starting to growl.\n\n“Let’s eat as soon as Lucas gets back…” Sharon said, her voice weak with hunger.\n\n“Meat! Let’s have meat!” Kate exclaimed.\n\n“And how about some booze to go with that?” Sharon suggested.\n\n“Now you’re talking!”\n\nThe two women high-fived each other excitedly.\n\nAron massaged his temples, trying to ignore their ridiculous conversation.\n\n“Seriously? You want to drink during a school trip…?”\n\n“Come on, just for a day!” Kate whined.\n\n“Yeah! I even brought your favorite Rebellion wine, and some Ritrona Honey Mead for Lucas.” Sharon added with a wink.\n\n“When did you even…?” Aron sputtered, but Sharon just winked again and snapped her fingers.\n\nA ripple of spatial distortion appeared in the air, and two bottles materialized with a soft thud.\n\n“Ta-da! Alcohol delivery!” Sharon announced proudly.\n\nAron stared at the bottles, one of which was covered in frost.\n\n“You stored wine in a frozen subspace?!” he exclaimed, exasperated. “And why are you wasting your high-level spatial magic on something like this?!”\n\n“What else am I supposed to use it for? It’s all about the little things in life.” Sharon said with a shrug, making the bottles disappear back into thin air.\n\nKate, who had been watching the exchange with amusement, leaned closer to Sharon.\n\n“Did you bring the Letun black beer?” she whispered.\n\n“Of course, I wouldn’t forget,” Sharon whispered back.\n\n“You’re the best…” Kate sighed happily.\n\nAnd so, the three professors continued to chat and joke amongst themselves, enjoying the rare break from their usual duties. The field trip, it seemed, had brought a newfound energy to not only the students but to the faculty as well.\n\nThey chatted excitedly about the feast they would have once Lucas returned.\n\nHowever, even as lunchtime came and went…\n\nLucas was nowhere to be found.\n\n***\n\nWe had been moving for hours.\n\nJudging by the sun’s position, it was almost noon, which meant we had been traveling for at least three hours.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just walking. We had ridden horses, crossed a river on a small boat…\n\n“Even with all the transportation, I’m still exhausted…” I mumbled, my vision blurring slightly from lack of sleep.\n\nWe had stopped for breaks, but it wasn't enough to make up for two sleepless nights.\n\nI pulled out another Deathweed, hoping to clear my head.\n\nThis was my seventh one today.\n\nNo, if I counted the ones I smoked throughout the night, it was closer to twenty.\n\n-Click, click…\n\nThe dry herb crackled between my lips as I lit it and took a long drag.\n\nAs I exhaled a plume of smoke, I noticed Violet staring at me.\n\n“….!”\n\nShe quickly averted her gaze, her cheeks flushing a bright red.\n\nHer head whipped around so quickly that her short purple hair briefly defied gravity, revealing the delicate curve of her neck.\n\n‘What’s with her?’\n\nI frowned, puzzled by her strange behavior.\n\n‘Is it because of what happened this morning…?’\n\nI mentally kicked myself. I had probably been too forward with her back then.\n\nShe was always so withdrawn, and I had just barged into her personal space without a second thought.\n\nI should have been more careful…\n\nLost in thought, I absentmindedly tapped the ash off my Deathweed.\n\nAll that came out of my mouth was a puff of smoke.\n\nI watched as it dissipated into the air, spreading out in all directions…\n\nWait a minute… all directions?\n\nSomething about the smoke’s movement felt off.\n\nI took another drag of my Deathweed, focusing on the smoke this time.\n\n“Huh…”\n\nInstead of drifting in a single direction, the smoke scattered haphazardly, as if caught in a chaotic wind.\n\nIt was like we had entered an area with unstable mana flow.\n\n“...”\n\nI exhaled a few more times, but the result was the same.\n\nThere was something wrong with the air currents.\n\nInstead of a gentle flow, there was a sense of unnatural turbulence, a subtle yet unsettling distortion.\n\nI looked around, trying to pinpoint the source of the disturbance.\n\nAt first glance, everything seemed normal.\n\nThe forest was a picturesque autumn scene, with vibrant red leaves contrasting against the white snow-dusted ground.\n\nSunlight streamed through the branches, casting dancing shadows on the forest floor.\n\nBut then I noticed it.\n\nThe silence.\n\nAn unnatural silence had descended upon the forest.\n\nThe cheerful chirping of birds that had filled the air moments ago…\n\nThe rustling of small animals in the undergrowth…\n\nThe distant roar of the waterfall…\n\nAll gone.\n\n‘Something…’\n\nSomething was definitely wrong.\n\nGolden Boy must have sensed it too, because he stopped walking and looked around nervously.\n\n“Hey, maniac…” he said, in his uncharacteristically tense voice.\n\n“Something’s not right…”\n\n“I know,”\n\nI replied, my hand instinctively reaching for the sword strapped to my waist.\n\n“What the hell…”\n\nGolden Boy muttered under his breath, scanning our surroundings with a wary eye.\n\nNow that we were paying attention, the signs were impossible to miss.\n\nA faint, metallic scent of blood hung in the air.\n\nAnd then there was the feeling…\n\nA prickling sensation on the back of my neck, like we were being watched.\n\nCold, predatory eyes, hidden somewhere in the depths of the forest.\n\n“...”\n\n“...”\n\nAn oppressive silence descended upon the clearing, broken only by the sound of our own ragged breathing.\n\nWe were at a standstill, caught in a silent standoff with an unseen enemy.\n\nThe tension was broken by Margaret, who had been oblivious to the shift in atmosphere.\n\nShe stood still, gazing at me and Golden Boy, her head tilted in confusion.\n\n“Um… why are you two just standing there…?”\n\n-Twang!\n\nThe sound of a bowstring snapping echoed through the clearing, followed by the sharp whistle of an arrow flying through the air.\n\nI barely had time to register what was happening before the arrow was upon us, aimed directly at Margaret’s throat.\n\n“Blink × 2!!”\n\n-Crack!\n\nMy body vanished in a flash of light, reappearing in front of Margaret.\n\nIt was too late to dodge.\n\nI shoved her aside with my left hand, raising my right hand to meet the incoming arrow.\n\n“Reflect!”\n\n-Clang!\n\nThe arrow, glowing with a malevolent black aura, collided with my mana-infused hand, the impact sending shockwaves through my arm.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Hide-and-seek\n\n“Reflect!”\n\n-Clang…!\n\nI barely managed to deflect the arrow that came flying at me with a sinister aura.\n\nThe sudden attack caught me off guard, and the force of the impact sliced through my fingertips, drawing blood.\n\nI bit back a curse, pressing my fingers against the wound to stop the bleeding.\n\n“Ra-Raiden?! Are you… what just happened?!”\n\n“Maniac!”\n\n“Y-Young Master Lishite…!”\n\nMy companions rushed to my side, their faces etched with concern.\n\n“I’m fine!” I snapped, raising a hand to stop them. “Just… stay alert!”\n\nMy words seemed to snap them out of their stupor. They quickly turned their attention back to the direction of the arrow.\n\nGolden Boy drew his practice mace from his belt, while Margaret and Violet began channeling their mana.\n\nI tore off a strip of cloth from my sleeve, quickly bandaging my wound before joining my companions in a defensive stance.\n\n“Sharp senses you’ve got there.”\n\nA voice, cold and menacing, cut through the silence.\n\nSeveral figures emerged from behind the trees, their forms shrouded in an ominous black aura.\n\nThey were clad in jet-black armor, their weapons glinting menacingly in the dappled sunlight. Beneath their helmets, I could make out glimpses of rotting flesh and glowing red eyes.\n\n“Undead…?”\n\nMargaret, who had been preparing a spell, faltered.\n\n“But… why are there Undead here? I didn’t sense any mana…”\n\n“Undead… that don’t emit mana?” I muttered, my brow furrowing.\n\nThat was impossible. As far as I knew, there was only one being in this world capable of creating such an abomination.\n\n“...The Four Heavenly Kings. Pyren.”\n\nThe Four Heavenly Kings…\n\nNo, that couldn’t be right. They weren’t supposed to appear until much later in the story.\n\nWhy was the plot going haywire?\n\n“Hey… Raiden…”\n\nGolden Boy nudged my shoulder, his face pale.\n\nHe pointed a trembling finger towards the back of the Undead ranks.\n\n“Look…”\n\n“What is it…?”\n\nI followed his gaze, forcing myself to remain calm.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nImpaled on the spear of the largest Undead, his head lolling at an unnatural angle…\n\nProfessor Lucas.\n\nHis emerald eyes, usually so full of life, were glazed over, staring blankly into the distance.\n\nMy mind screeched to a halt.\n\nProfessor Lucas… was supposed to be back at base camp.\n\nWhy…? How…?\n\nDead…?\n\nNo. It couldn’t be.\n\n“I-I must be… seeing things…” I muttered, my voice hollow.\n\nPlease, let this be some kind of sick hallucination.\n\nBut Golden Boy’s reply shattered my hopes into a million pieces.\n\n“Well, whatever it is… we’re both seeing the same thing.”\n\n“...”\n\nThis has to be a lie.\n\nI wanted to scream those words, but they wouldn’t come out.\n\nProfessor Lucas… dead?\n\nHe was one of the strongest mages in the Academy, second only to Headmistress Korn. How could he…\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat, my carefully constructed composure crumbling like a house of cards.\n\nJust yesterday, we were talking and laughing… and now…\n\nHe was dead.\n\nA cold dread gripped my heart, squeezing the air from my lungs.\n\nI stumbled back, my vision swimming.\n\n“Gah…haah…”\n\nGet a hold of yourself, Raiden.\n\nI bit down on my tongue, hard, the metallic tang of blood filling my mouth. I had to stay conscious. If I lost it now, we were all dead.\n\nThat thought, grim and desperate, was the only thing keeping me tethered to reality.\n\n-Remember, Raiden. In any match, the first rule is to stay calm.\n\n-Train with the mindset that any moment of weakness will lead to your defeat.\n\nIronically, it was my father’s “teachings” that brought me back from the brink.\n\nThe countless hours of verbal and physical abuse had been seared into my very being, and now, they were the only thing keeping me from completely falling apart.\n\nI swallowed down the bile rising in my throat, repeating those words like a mantra.\n\nRight. This was a match.\n\nA match where I had to stay calm, no matter what.\n\nA match where a single moment of weakness would spell my doom.\n\nAnd I couldn’t afford to lose.\n\nNot when…\n\n“I… can’t… lose…”\n\nI muttered to myself like a crazy person.\n\nI opened my eyes, a newfound resolve hardening my gaze.\n\nMy mind, now ice-cold and calculating, quickly assessed the situation.\n\nWe were completely outmatched.\n\nWe had no proper equipment, while the Undead were armed to the teeth.\n\nAnd there were at least twenty of them, five times our number.\n\nWe were exhausted from hours of travel, while they…\n\n‘We can’t win in a straight fight.’\n\nThese weren’t your average, run-of-the-mill Undead.\n\nThese were Pyren’s elite, imbued with a chilling power that sent shivers down my spine.\n\nI glanced at Golden Boy, who was watching me with a mixture of fear and anticipation.\n\n“...”\n\n“...”\n\nWe locked eyes, a silent understanding passing between us. He was already a step ahead, his body tensed, ready to spring into action.\n\nI gave him a curt nod.\n\n“Golden Boy,”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\nHe gripped his mace tightly, his muscles coiling like a spring.\n\n“Run. Now!”\n\nAs soon as the words left my mouth, Golden Boy launched himself forward, his mace whistling through the air.\n\nIt connected with the head of the leading Undead knight with a sickening crunch.\n\n-Bang!!\n\nThe impact caved in the Undead’s helmet, sending a spray of black, viscous blood splattering across the forest floor.\n\nThe Undead ranks faltered for a moment, momentarily stunned by the unexpected attack.\n\nIt was all the time we needed.\n\nI grabbed Margaret, while Golden Boy scooped up Violet, and we ran.\n\n“Kyaaa!”\n\n“Whoa!”\n\nThe first chapter of the Academy’s “Combat Tactics” textbook flashed through my mind.\n\nRule number four for surviving a battle:\n\nIf you encounter an enemy you cannot defeat, retreat immediately.\n\n“Move, maniac!”\n\nWe didn’t need to be told twice.\n\nWe turned and fled, our pursuers hot on our heels.\n\n“They’re gaining on us!” Margaret cried, her voice laced with panic.\n\n“Just keep running!” I shouted back, pushing myself harder.\n\nAnd so began a deadly game of hide-and-seek in the heart of the forest.\n\n***\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Meanwhile, back at base camp…\n\nTwo figures sat facing each other across a small, round table.\n\nAron and Kate.\n\nTheir faces, usually so full of life, were now pale with worry as they stared at the clock ticking ominously on the table.\n\n-Tick tock… tick tock…\n\nThe relentless ticking of the second hand seemed to amplify the silence that had settled over the camp.\n\nIt was already two in the afternoon, long past lunchtime.\n\n“Lucas still isn’t back…” Kate said, her voice heavy with apprehension.\n\nAron tapped his fingers nervously on the table.\n\n“Lunch was supposed to be at noon… It’s been two hours…”\n\n“Has he ever been late before?”\n\n“Not that I can recall… Not once in the past five years.”\n\nKate bit her lip, her anxiety growing with each passing moment.\n\n“He did say he had a bad feeling about this… right before he left for his patrol…”\n\n“Yeah…” Aron muttered, his gut twisting uncomfortably.\n\nHe couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong.\n\nThey had been colleagues for years, and Lucas was never late.\n\nHe was an assassin, and precision was in his blood. He lived by the creed of punctuality.\n\nAnd yet… here they were.\n\n“Something’s wrong…” Kate whispered, her voice trembling slightly.\n\n“Don’t say that…” Aron said, trying to sound reassuring, but he couldn’t quite manage it.\n\nHe was starting to fear the worst.\n\nSuddenly, Sharon burst out of the staff tent, her face flushed and her eyes wide with alarm.\n\n“Aron! Kate!”\n\n“What is it, Sharon?” Kate asked, her brow furrowing in concern.\n\n“One of the emergency communication devices… it just went offline!”\n\n“What?!”\n\n“We have a situation!”\n\nSharon dumped a pile of small, box-like devices onto the table. They were blinking erratically, emitting a faint, red glow.\n\nShe picked up a few of them, her voice trembling slightly as she explained.\n\n“These are the communication devices for all thirty teams… see anything strange?”\n\n“Why is the light off on… Team Four’s device?”\n\n“The connection’s been cut. Someone’s disrupted the mana lines…”\n\n“Disrupted? Are you sure? Maybe it’s just a malfunction…”\n\n“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Aron!”\n\nSharon pounded her chest, exasperated by Aron's indifferent response.\n\n“I made these devices! They don’t just malfunction! Don’t you understand how serious this is? Someone has tampered with the mana lines!”\n\n“Tampered? You mean… it’s not just a simple mana shortage?”\n\n“Yes! Are you finally getting it?!”\n\nSharon’s outburst brought Aron to his senses.\n\nA disruption in the mana lines…\n\nIt sounded like a simple mana shortage, but it was anything but.\n\nNormally, magical devices malfunction due to a lack of external mana.\n\nBut a disruption in the mana lines… that was something else entirely. It was akin to a barrier, a veil that prevented the magical signals from reaching their intended destination.\n\nTo put it simply, it was a barrier that didn’t block the flow of mana itself, but rather, the communication signals that flowed through it.\n\nIt was a difficult and highly advanced form of magic, one that went against the very laws of the world.\n\n“And you know what’s worse? None of us… felt a thing.”\n\n“...”\n\n“...”\n\nAron and Kate exchanged a horrified look.\n\nShe was right.\n\nThey hadn’t felt a thing.\n\nNot a single ripple of magical energy, not even a faint tremor.\n\nAnd these were some of the most powerful mages on the continent.\n\n“You’re saying…”\n\n“We’re dealing with someone… or something… powerful enough to mask their magical signature from us,”\n\n“Tinamithius… help us…”\n\n“This isn’t about Lucas anymore!”\n\n“If my theory is correct… then all the students on this island… they’re all in danger! We have to do something!”\n\n“Damn it!”\n\nAron shot to his feet, his chair clattering to the ground. He shrugged on his coat, his hand instinctively reaching for the pair of knuckles he always carried with him.\n\nWith Lucas gone, he was the senior-most professor present. The responsibility for the safety of the students now fell upon his shoulders.\n\n“Sharon, pinpoint the location of Team Four’s last known signal,”\n\n“And send out an emergency message to all teams. Tell them to return to base camp immediately!”\n\n“R-Right!”\n\n“Kate, you go and alert the other professors,”\n\n“We need to get everyone back to safety as quickly as possible!”\n\n“What in the world is going on?!” Kate exclaimed, her voice laced with panic.\n\nSharon immediately began fiddling with the communication devices, while Kate, her entire body enveloped in a faint, blue glow, shot off towards the other base camps.\n\nAron, not wasting another second, sprinted towards the stables, where the horses were kept.\n\n“I’ll leave things here to you, Sharon,”\n\n“Aron, where are you going?” Sharon called after him.\n\n“To the location of Team Four’s last signal,”\n\n“Team Four… you mean…”\n\n“Yes, the team with Raiden and Margaret,” Aron said grimly.\n\n“They’re both from Duke’s families! This is a disaster waiting to happen!”\n\nJust then, a new voice, calm yet laced with regal authority, spoke from behind them.\n\n“You say the communication device for Young Master Lishite’s team has gone offline…?”\n\nSharon and Aron spun around, their eyes widening in surprise as they recognized the speaker.\n\n“Y-Your Highness?!”\n\nTheir eyes fell on the Empire's First Princess, Lucy von Lietrio.\n\nHer blue eyes, trembling slightly, were fixed on the two professors.\n\n“Tell me,”\n\n“What has happened to Young Master Lishite?”\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Thunk!\n\nThe sound of a bowstring being pulled echoed again.\n\nAnother arrow whizzed past my ear, the sound of it embedding itself in a nearby tree sending a shiver down my spine.\n\nAs I was about to chant the incantation for Blink to dodge the flying arrow, a gust of wind blew.\n\n\"Crossing Wind!\"\n\n-Crackle!\n\nA green blade launched with a single-word incantation shot down the arrow that was rushing towards me.\n\nWith a swift motion, Margaret's magic sword sliced through the air, deflecting the arrow.\n\n\"I'll block the attacks, you just run!\"\n\nShe said that and loaded mana into her fingertips again.\n\nI nodded, trying my best.\n\nDesperately, my legs were reaching their limit.\n\nI was already extremely fatigued, and it was a miracle that I was even running without falling.\n\nI clenched my teeth to try and regain my blurry vision.\n\nThis won't do.\n\nIt would take at least 30 minutes to reach the spot where the horses were tied up.\n\nMy stamina stat wasn't high enough to endure that time.\n\nI'd probably fall around the 20-minute mark.\n\n'And... at this distance, they'll catch us while we're riding.'\n\nPlus, after the forest ends, the plains stretch out, making it easier for them to chase us.\n\nThanks to this shitty situation, I only had one option left.\n\nTo lose them in this forest.\n\nBut... I couldn't think of a way.\n\nThe enemies' speed exceeded my expectations, and our stamina was running out.\n\nOn the other hand, they were undead. They wouldn't get tired or fall unless their heads were cut off or purified.\n\n'Damn... what should I...!'\n\nAs I was racking my brains, Margaret intercepted another volley of arrows.\n\nIt was probably because of her Wind Magic specialty, but the air was swirling like a typhoon around her.\n\n-Flutter…\n\nSomething caught my eye in the chaotic situation.\n\nIt was a map, fluttering in the wind, attached to the front of Margaret's outer garment.\n\nIt was a detailed map of this forest.\n\nAs I saw a corner of the paper passing by, I found a clue that might be a breakthrough for this situation.\n\n'Mutan River Canyon...?'\n\nThere was a massive canyon with a large river running through it, about 200 meters from our current location.\n\nIt was 43 meters high, and the gap between the canyons was 11 meters.\n\n'This is it...!'\n\nIf we reached this point and jumped over the canyon, we could lose the undead.\n\nIt was a long shot, but it was our only chance.\n\nI shouted to Golden Boy, who was running ahead,\n\n“Golden Boy! Take that side path! I’ll distract them!”\n\n“What?! What about you and the Young Lady?!”\n\n“I have a plan! Just go!”\n\n“Damn it! Fine!”\n\nFollowing my instructions, He quickly changed course.\n\nI jumped around to make sure he didn't attract their attention.\n\n\"Over here! You dead bastards!\"\n\nAs soon as Golden Boy disappeared into the thicket, the knights stepped up their pace.\n\nI had no choice but to increase my speed as well.\n\nMy breath was getting tighter, and my lungs were burning like crazy.\n\nI kept moving my legs, forcing my tear-filled eyes open, and the edge of the canyon came into view in the distance.\n\n\"Ah, it's a dead end!\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nMargaret screamed in surprise, seeing the cliff in front of us.\n\nI grabbed her body tighter, making sure she didn't move.\n\n\"Wait, what are you trying to...!\"\n\n\"I'm going to jump over it.

It was a perfect jump.\n\n10 meters to the safe zone.\n\nThe perfect distance.\n\nI let out a smug thought and moved my lips.\n\n\"Blink 10.\"\n\n-Crackle!\n\nThe scenery flickered, and my body moved.\n\nNaturally, the ground on the opposite side of the canyon should be beneath my feet...\n\nWait.\n\nWhy am I still floating in the air?\n\nMy Blink activated, but there was no ground beneath my feet.\n\nWhat the...?\n\nWhat caught my eye was the opposite side of the canyon, about 2 meters away.\n\nThe distance was insufficient.\n\nMy calculations were perfect...?\n\nJust before my body, which had been bouncing upwards, stopped resisting gravity and started to fall.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[You are using the skill 'Short-Range Teleportation (Blink)' 10 times.]\n\n[The remaining usable count for the skill 'Short-Range Teleportation (Blink)' is only 8 times.]\n\n[The number of uses is changed from 10 times to 8 times.]\n\nBlue windows flashed before my eyes.\n\nOnly then did I realize that I had used two stocks to block the arrows aimed at Margaret earlier.\n\nAh... shit.\n\nMy body had stopped floating and was falling.\n\nI quickly threw Margaret's body towards the canyon.\n\n\"You...?\"\n\nMargaret looked at me as she flew.\n\n\"Run aw-!\"\n\nI couldn't answer her call to the end.\n\nBecause I was starting to plummet into the deep abyss.\n\nThe blue sky briefly came into view, then quickly disappeared.\n\n-Raiden...!!\n\nI could hear Margaret's scream, but it quickly faded away.\n\nThe wind whipped against my face, and the chilling sense of speed made my body tremble.\n\nI was falling towards death, cutting through the air.\n\nI saw the river flowing peacefully far below.\n\nMy body would probably turn into mush the moment it hit the water.\n\nThey call it a life flashing before your eyes, and a brief memory of my previous life came to mind.\n\nCome to think of it, I died falling like this back then too.\n\nWill it hurt a lot this time...\n\nThe notification sound from the status window brought my panicked mind back.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The skill 'Short-Range Teleportation (Blink)' has been charged once.]\n\n[Remaining usable count (1/10)]\n\n[Next charge in 1 hour 29 minutes 59 seconds]\n\nI chuckled bitterly.\n\nWhat good is it charging now?\n\nIn 3 seconds, I'll hit the water, and my body will be like a tomato thrown against a wall.\n\nEven with such pessimistic thoughts, I moved my lips.\n\n\"Blink...!\"\n\nWith the sound of sparks, my body moved to the edge of the cliff.\n\nMy hand had already pulled out Sorrow from subspace.\n\nUsing the shop would be too slow.\n\nI needed to be as fast as possible to increase my chances of survival.\n\nI clenched Sorrow tightly and plunged it into the cliff next to me.\n\n-Kwang-kwang-kwang-kwang!!!\n\nThe blunt scabbard pierced the rock.\n\nStone fragments flew out with a rough shattering sound.\n\nIt was a stupid method, but there was no other way.\n\nI had to reduce my speed and lessen the impact on my body.\n\n'Still...

Looks like a few of them followed us!\"\n\n\"Eek...! W-What do we do? G-Golden Boy?\"\n\nViolet whimpered, shrinking behind him.\n\nHer eyes were already welling up with tears.\n\nGolden Boy shrugged with a carefree expression.\n\n\"Well~? Guess we die. It looks like Professor Lucas is already dead, how are we supposed to fight these guys?\"\n\n\"W-W-What do you mean...!\"\n\nEven in this situation, Golden Boy couldn't help but tease, while Violet trembled in fear.\n\nAs they stood frozen, the undead knights slowly advanced towards them.\n\nGolden Boy clenched his fist, letting out a soft sigh.\n\n\"Still too young to die...\"\n\nHe took a stance as if preparing for battle.\n\nThen, taking a deep breath, he muttered to Violet.\n\n\"Go.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Go on ahead. Back to base camp.\"\n\nViolet's eyes widened at his nonchalant words.\n\nGolden Boy, ignoring her reaction, kept his gaze fixed on the approaching figures of death.\n\n\"If you go a little further from here, you'll find the horses... Go to the camp and get the professors.\"\n\n\"B-But then... what about you, Golden Boy...!\"\n\n\"You're such a handful. I'm saying you're a liability in a fight, so get going.\"\n\nGolden Boy chided the hesitant Violet, a relaxed smile gracing his lips.\n\n\"I'll hold them off for a bit and follow you.\"\n\n\"T-That's a death flag...\"\n\n\"Just go, will you?\"\n\n-Clank, clank...\n\nEven as they bickered, the undead continued their advance.\n\nFinally forced to make a choice, Violet began to run with tears streaming down her face.\n\n\"I-I'll come back with the professors...!\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\nGolden Boy watched Violet disappear into the bushes, then let out a breath.\n\nAs he chuckled, seemingly relieved, one of the knights, now within striking distance, spoke.\n\n\"For, your, noble, sacrifice, we, offer, you, respect.\"\n\n\"What was that? I thought the captain guy spoke fine, why's your tongue all messed up? Did it rot or something?\"\n\nGolden Boy taunted the knight despite their proximity, showing no signs of fear.\n\nMistaking his words for the bravado of a child, the undead knights pointed their swords at him.\n\n\"Foolish, child, do, not, beg, for, your, life... Death, comes, for, us, all.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nGolden Boy stared at the knight, who was threatening him with a chilling voice, his expression blank.\n\nThen, he closed his eyes and casually picked at his ear.\n\n\"Hey... You got it all wrong, you know?\"\n\n\"What, do, you, mean?\"\n\nThe knights tilted their heads in confusion at the boy's mischievous grin.\n\nThe next moment, Golden Boy wiped the playful smirk off his face and opened his eyes.\n\n\"You guys are picking a fight with the wrong person.\"\n\nA sharp voice, loud enough to pierce their eardrums, struck the knights.\n\nThey instinctively took a step back, raising their weapons.\n\nIt was a primal fear.\n\nThe fear of a prey facing its predator.\n\nThe knights stared at 'it' with trembling eyes.\n\nThe lighthearted boy who had been talking to them just moments ago was gone.\n\nAll that remained was a being radiating overwhelming power.\n\n-Crackle, crackle...!\n\nBlue electricity crackled around the boy's entire body.\n\nAt the same time, his blonde hair gradually turned white, as if bleached.\n\nHis blue eyes blazed with an ecstatic light.\n\n\"Whoa... This feels nostalgic! Haven't shown this form in years since I've been hiding it!\"\n\nGolden Boy, now transformed, muttered, fiddling with the blue sparks dancing around his fingertips.\n\nWhite hair and blue lightning.\n\nOne of the stunned knights gasped at the boy's distinctive appearance.\n\n\"Don't tell me... You're one of the Thunder Dragon's kin...?\"\n\n\"Oh, you recognize it?\"\n\n\"Of, course... We've, had, our, fair, share, of, trouble, with, Dragons.\"\n\n\"Well~ I guess there were a lot of dragons back when you guys were alive, huh? You look like you're from about a thousand years ago.\"\n\n\"Are, there, not, many, Dragons, now?\"\n\n\"They're pretty much extinct.\"\n\n\"I, see.\"\n\nGolden Boy casually answered the knight's question and clenched his sparking fist.\n\nHis entire arm, including his hand, began to glow blue, emitting high-voltage electricity.\n\n\"Well then, enough chit-chat...\"\n\n-Bzzzt!!!\n\nThe boy's white hair fluttered in the surging lightning.\n\nGolden Boy, with his usual light smile, snapped his fingers.\n\n\"Die.\"\n\nWith a short sentence of death, a primordial thunderbolt engulfed the black knights.\n\nThe blue lightning incinerated the bodies without a trace, leaving nothing but ash.\n\nAs the dust settled, only the white-haired boy stood there, calm and composed.\n\n***\n\n-Roooar...!\n\nThe raging sound of water filled the air.\n\nThe powerful current crashed against the rocks, roaring violently.\n\nRaiden, who had lost consciousness due to the deafening noise, finally opened his eyes.\n\n\"Cough! Cough!!\"\n\nHe woke up with a gasp, clutching his throat and coughing up a large amount of water.\n\nAfter several dry heaves, he finally emptied his lungs of the river water that had filled them.\n\nOnly then could he regain his senses.\n\n\"Gasp... Gasp, ha...\"\n\nRaiden looked around, breathing heavily.\n\nHe was lying at the edge of the Mutan River.\n\nHe must have been swept here by the current.\n\nRelieved that he hadn't been carried all the way out to sea, he collapsed back onto the ground.\n\n\"Cough! Cough! I'm... I'm alive...\"\n\nHe mumbled, gasping for air.\n\nPain shot through his entire body.\n\nThanks to slowing down his fall, he had avoided being squashed like a tomato, but he was far from unharmed.\n\n\"Ha... Ha... This is... not the time to be lying down...\"\n\nRaiden gritted his teeth and forced his aching upper body up.\n\nExhaustion and excruciating muscle pain weighed him down.\n\nThe urge to lie back down was almost overwhelming, but he bit his lip and pushed it away.\n\n\"The others... I hope they got away safely...\"\n\nRaiden murmured with a worried expression.\n\nHe was less concerned about Golden Boy and Violet since they were together, but he couldn't shake off the worry about Margaret.\n\n\"I wonder if she's alright... She must think I'm dead.\"\n\nLike most kind-hearted people, Margaret was sensitive.\n\nShe might appear tough and strong on the outside, but she was more easily hurt than anyone else he knew.\n\nFor someone like her to witness his death...\n\nThe shock must have been immense.\n\n\"......I need to get back to her.\"\n\nRaiden picked up Sorrow, which was lying on the ground, and used it as a walking stick.\n\nHe had to hurry.\n\nAlthough he had blacked out, it didn't seem like that much time had passed.\n\nMaybe an hour at most?\n\nIf the knights hadn't found a way to cross the canyon yet, they might still be lurking around the forest.\n\nHe needed to get out of here and rejoin the others at the base camp as soon as possible...\n\n-Clank, clank, clank...\n\nAs Raiden limped through the trees, a familiar sound reached his ears.\n\nThe clanging of metal against metal.\n\n\"......Don't tell me.\"\n\nHe stiffened, turning his head towards the source of the sound.\n\n\"Oh... come on, this is just unfair...\"\n\nThere, staring at him with glowing red eyes, were more undead knights.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

At the rattling sound, I turned my head in disbelief.\n\nAs I’d feared, the situation I was worried about had just popped up.\n\nI looked at the Undead Knights approaching me and broke out in a cold sweat.\n\n“This… This is so fucked up…”\n\nThe moment our eyes met, I thought about running away.\n\nBut I had no choice but to give up.\n\nI figured I’d collapse from exhaustion if I tried to run away from them in this state, like before.\n\nI didn't think I could outrun those undead in the first place.\n\nWhat the… Fast undead, seriously?\n\n“Pyren… What the hell kind of chimera did this bastard create…?”\n\nDoes that senile old geezer think he’s a god just because he’s showing off his skills after a long time?\n\nI spat out the blood that had pooled in my mouth, cursing their creator, who was nowhere to be seen.\n\n“Ha… Hoo…”\n\nI struggled to regain my balance with my wobbly legs.\n\nI put Sorrow, which I had been using as a walking stick, into the subspace.\n\nI bought a sword from the shop and quietly raised it.\n\nThe tip of the sword trembled as my arm muscles kept spasming.\n\nI frowned at the pain that racked my entire body.\n\n“My body is in a hell of a state…”\n\nI think if I get hit once, I’ll die instantly.\n\nTwo days of sleep deprivation and minor injuries combined were driving me crazy.\n\nOf course, those things in front of me wouldn't care about my condition and would point their swords at me.\n\n-Thud, thud… Slash!\n\nThe Undead Knights, sensing that I had no intention of running away,\n\nbegan to draw their swords and take their stances.\n\n“...Isn't this too much?”\n\nThirteen swords were aiming for my neck.\n\nAfter a brief standoff, the one who seemed to be the leader stepped forward.\n\nIt was the bastard with Professor Lucas’s head tied to the end of his spear.\n\n“Your escape ends here.”\n\n“You don't have to tell me… ”\n\nI replied irritably, holding my sword with both hands.\n\nPerhaps because I was exhausted, the sword felt particularly heavy.\n\nTo buy myself some time to rest, I pointed at the head hanging from his spear shaft and asked,\n\n“Professor Lucas’s head… Why is it hanging like that?”\n\n“It’s common on the battlefield. The head of the enemy general is hung in a visible place to demoralize the enemy troops.”\n\nThe Undead Knight raised his spear high.\n\nThen, he lightly shook Professor Lucas’s head and laughed at me mockingly.\n\n“And, it can also inflict psychological damage on the opponent.”\n\n“…”\n\n“I saw it clearly. The moment you first witnessed this, your eyes shook violently… I guess he was someone precious to you?”\n\n“…You crazy bastard.”\n\n“Don't be too angry. It’s all just part of the strategy.”\n\nThe knight acted up as if to provoke me.\n\nI had to admit,\n\nhis strategy was working perfectly.\n\nI was angrier now than I had ever been since I faced the Seekers.\n\nI wanted to rip that disgusting mouth to shreds right away.\n\nBut I couldn’t show it.\n\nBecause that was a step towards defeat and death.\n\nI tried to keep a straight face and concentrated on my sword.\n\n“Oh… You’re no ordinary man. You should’ve lost your mind and jumped at me by now.”\n\n“You think you’re the only one who’s good at trash-talking?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“What you’re doing is… pathetic.”\n\nHaving grown up listening to my father’s verbal abuse every day, I wasn’t going to be swayed by such childish pranks.\n\nI was too jaded to be fazed by emotional fluctuations.\n\nAnger was just an explosive that boosted my performance.\n\n“Come.”\n\n“Haha…! Excellent!”\n\nAs I tilted my sword and took the basic stance of Kendo, the knight laughed out loud.\n\nThen, he swung his spear shaft and quickly charged towards me.\n\nThe other undead followed him.\n\n-Thump, thump, thud, thud!\n\nHeavy footsteps echoed, and the next moment.\n\nThe terrible clang of metal clashing against metal began to flash among the maple-colored bushes.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nAt the entrance of the forest where the children were in danger.\n\n“Giddy up!”\n\n-Neigh!\n\nThe sound of horses’ hooves pounding on the ground echoed through the air.\n\nTwo horses were running through the sea of red leaves, splitting the wind.\n\nOn top of them were none other than the tanned, bald professor and the platinum blonde girl.\n\nAron shook the reins incessantly and shouted at Lucy, who was speeding ahead of him.\n\n“Your Highness! Please slow down! It's dangerous!”\n\n“There’s no time to dawdle! You said Raiden might be in danger!”\n\nLucy ignored Aron’s cries and accelerated further. Aron let out a small groan at the sight of the girl who wouldn’t listen.\n\nOriginally, Aron was supposed to move alone to rescue the students.\n\nHowever, the plan went awry when Lucy, who had overheard the professors’ conversation, insisted on going with him.\n\nIt was driving Aron crazy.\n\nUnlike her younger sister, Neria, she was a student who was loved for her understanding and gentle nature despite being a royal.\n\nShe had changed completely as soon as the subject of Raiden came up.\n\nSharon explained the seriousness of the situation and even dared to scold her, but Lucy wouldn’t budge.\n\n-Please… I beg you.\n\n-I finally found him again, I can’t lose him again…\n\nThe girl just sobbed, saying things that made no sense.\n\nShe seemed to have lost her mind.\n\nNot knowing what kind of trouble she would cause if he left her alone, Aron eventually had to allow her to accompany him.\n\nOf course, the condition was that she would be accompanied by her knights.\n\n-Calm down, Aron.\n\n-It’ll be alright since you and the knights are with her.\n\n-They're all skilled. It might even be safer than the base camp.\n\nAron looked back, chewing on the comfort Sharon had given him.\n\nThere, about ten escort knights were following on horseback.\n\nEach one of them was a platoon made up of forces equivalent to the Academy professors.\n\nTaking comfort in their presence, Aron shook the reins.\n\nAs Aron spurred his horse and pulled up alongside Lucy,\n\nLucy, who had been staring straight ahead, turned to him and asked,\n\n“Where did you say Young Master Lishite’s signal was last detected?!”\n\n“It’s in the middle of the forest! If we keep going like this, we’ll soon reach a large canyon. We should be fine if we follow the border!”\n\n-Clack, clack…\n\nThe sound of horses’ hooves echoed roughly through the bushes.\n\nThe professor and the princess ran and ran in search of the missing children.\n\n***\n\nAt the time when Lucy and Aron were continuing their chase.\n\nIn the heart of the forest, a boy was sitting down, breathing heavily.\n\n“Haha… This is getting old…”\n\nIn front of the boy lay the wreckage of shattered trees and rock fragments.\n\nThe boy, who lightly pushed away the jet-black armor that touched his feet, let out a hollow laugh and brushed his bangs back.\n\n“The silence after a battle is always so bland.”\n\nGolden Boy muttered, dusting off his blackened right arm.\n\nHe withdrew the electricity remaining on his fingertips.\n\nAs the flickering blue light scattered, the boy’s hair began to turn from white back to blonde.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere remained the same.\n\nInstead of his usual goofy expression, a cold chill hung over the boy’s face.\n\nGolden Boy, who had been silent as if reminiscing about something, suddenly vomited a mouthful of blood.\n\n“…Cough.”\n\nGolden Boy bowed his head and coughed up thick, bloody phlegm.\n\nPerhaps because it was a power he hadn’t used in a while, the aftereffects hit him late.\n\nEvery time he retched, his white shirt became heavily stained with dark red marks.\n\n“Tsk…”\n\nGolden Boy wiped his mouth and clicked his tongue.\n\nOn his forearm was a gruesome lightning-shaped scar.\n\nA wound he had inflicted on himself, vowing to avenge his clan.\n\nThe boy hid it under his sleeve with a faint sigh.\n\nAs the scar disappeared from sight, Golden Boy returned to his usual lighthearted demeanor.\n\nHe picked up a sword that was rolling on the ground.\n\nIt was the sword used by the undead that had just turned to ashes.\n\nGolden Boy stabbed himself in the abdomen several times with it, deliberately inflicting wounds.\n\n“Hua… It’s over. Shall we go back to base camp now~?”\n\nEven with the blood gushing out, the boy’s expression looked relaxed.\n\nGolden Boy lightly pressed his hand against the wound to stop the bleeding and started walking.\n\n“Come to think of it… I wonder what happened to that maniac?”\n\n***\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Haa...\"\n\nI exhaled deeply at the invigorating energy flooding my senses.\n\nA deep blue aura flickered around my body.\n\nPerhaps because I was fully wielding Sorrow, the effects of Extrasensory seemed far more potent than usual.\n\nFor a moment, I gazed at Sorrow, radiating explosive energy, then quickly collected myself and shifted my gaze towards the enemies.\n\n\"...\"\n\nMy eyes met the Undead Knight, frozen like statues.\n\nThe one who appeared to be the leader stared at me silently, then quietly spoke.\n\n\"A Divine Artifact... and a rather high-ranking sword at that.\"\n\nAs expected, he recognized it immediately.\n\nI frowned, letting out a low groan.\n\nWell, it would be stranger if he didn't notice, considering the grand show it was putting on.\n\n\"Haa...\"\n\nThis was exactly why I tried to avoid drawing it from its sheath if possible.\n\nI sighed and surveyed the surroundings.\n\nFortunately, the dense forest seemed to have masked the unique energy signature of the Divine Artifact, preventing it from leaking outwards.\n\nIt shouldn't be visible from afar.\n\nThat's a small relief.\n\nThings would definitely get complicated if others were to find out.\n\n\"The atmosphere has shifted. This will be interesting.\"\n\n\"What are you babbling about, you rotten corpse?\"\n\nThe undead sneered, their eyes fixated on me with a chilling glint.\n\nI raised my middle finger towards their hateful gazes and started manipulating my status window.\n\n\"Store, buy the special effects 'Pain Oblivion' and 'Iron Body'... and three bottles of 'Intermediate Mana Potion.'\"\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Purchase complete.]\n\n[Total Points Spent: 1050P]\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Special Effect 'Pain Oblivion' activated.]\n\n[All physical pain will be reduced by 99% for the next 30 minutes.]\n\n-Ding!\n\n[Special Effect 'Iron Body' applied.]\n\n[Your physical condition will be enhanced to its peak for the next 20 minutes.]\n\n[However, after the effect's duration, you will receive 3 times the accumulated damage.]\n\nMy entire body, ravaged by exhaustion and injuries, was instantly revitalized by the special effects.\n\nThe bleeding from my wounds stopped, and my weary muscles began to swell.\n\nSimultaneously, the pain vanished, and the warning signals my body had been screaming were silenced.\n\n\"Finally, some relief...\"\n\nIt was a hefty price to pay in points, but I brushed it off, considering it a worthy investment.\n\nI chugged down the mana potions that materialized in front of me.\n\n-Ding!\n\n['Intermediate Mana Potion' consumed.]\n\n[Depleted mana partially restored.]\n\n[Skill 'Short Range Teleportation (Blink)' charges replenished: 6 charges.]\n\nNot only had I recovered my physical condition, but I had also partially restored my Blink charges.\n\nThis was a fight I could handle, even with the limited time.\n\nI took a light step forward and assumed my stance.\n\nThe jet-black blade of Sorrow pointed towards the knights.\n\nPanic flickered across their faces.\n\nIt seemed they were surprised to see me perfectly fine after I was just barely holding on.\n\nIgnoring their reactions, I shattered the tense silence that had settled over the battlefield.\n\n-Kwaang!\n\nThe ground caved in where I stood as I kicked off.\n\nMy body shot forward like a bullet, aimed at the undead.\n\nOne of the knights reacted to my surprise attack and intercepted me, thrusting a massive shield forward.\n\nHe seemed intent on meeting my charge head-on.\n\nA smirk played on my lips.\n\nYou're going to regret that decision.\n\n-Sswaeeeeeek!!\n\nAs my blade sliced through the air and clashed against the shield, I locked eyes with the knight's barely visible face and roared,\n\n\"Die...!\"\n\nThe instant Sorrow was swung, a beautiful silver line etched itself onto the air.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, the world seemed to slow down.\n\nThe dazzling strike captivated everything in sight, painting a mesmerizing spectacle.\n\nThe captivating scene reached its climax as the shield was cleaved in two, like a melon sliced by a hot knife, and the knight behind it was bisected along with it.\n\nMoments later, the undead, severed in half, collapsed onto the ground.\n\n-Thud...\n\nThe belated sound of the cut echoed gracefully.\n\nIt was a sound that sent shivers down one's spine.\n\nWithout hesitation, I took another step forward.\n\nMy next target was the archer positioned behind the shield-bearer.\n\nThe archer, shocked at my swift approach, frantically drew his bowstring.\n\n-Twang, Shwooosh!\n\nThe arrow, loosed from the bow, came hurtling towards me, aiming for my neck.\n\nHowever, I had no intention of blocking it.\n\nI simply reached out.\n\nThe feeling of omnipotence emanating from Sorrow filled me with confidence.\n\nI felt like I could easily catch even such an arrow now.\n\n-Crack!\n\n\"......?!\"\n\nAs I snatched the incoming arrow out of the air, the archer stumbled back in astonishment.\n\nI reversed my grip on the arrow and plunged it into the face of the retreating archer.\n\n-Kwaduk!!\n\nThe arrow pierced through the gap in his helmet, finding its mark with deadly accuracy.\n\nI could feel the archer's eyeball being crushed and his brain being pierced through my fingertips.\n\nWith a shallow breath, I kicked away the twitching armor, sending his body crashing to the ground with a loud thud.\n\n\"...Ha.\"\n\nBarely 20 seconds had passed.\n\nI still had about 9 minutes left before the Extrasensory wore off.\n\nI nonchalantly kicked away the archer's head, which had rolled to my feet, and glared at the remaining knights.\n\nTheir eyes burned with intensified murderous intent.\n\nWiping off the rotten blood splattered on my cheek, I declared,\n\n\"No time to waste... Let's finish this quickly.\"\n\nAnd with that, I charged at the knights.\n\nThey met my advance, brandishing their weapons.\n\nFor a while, the forest echoed with the deafening clash of steel and the rustling of undergrowth.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, a few minutes before the full-fledged battle began.\n\nLucy and Aron were galloping through the forest, riding alongside the canyon of the Mutan River.\n\n\"Raiden! Raiden! Answer me if you can hear me!\"\n\nLucy shouted desperately, pouring all her emotions into her voice.\n\nBut no matter how many times she called out to the boy, only the cold wind answered.\n\nLucy tightened her grip on the reins, trying to suppress the growing unease within her.\n\nJust then, Aron, who was riding beside her, pointed to a spot in the canyon and exclaimed,\n\n\"Your Highness! There's someone up ahead!\"\n\n\"Where?!\"\n\nLucy reacted quickly, her gaze following the direction Aron's finger was pointing.\n\nAbout 100 meters ahead, she saw a lone girl sitting on the ground.\n\n\"Is that...?\"\n\nThrough the unclear silhouette, she could faintly make out silver hair.\n\nThe moment she saw it, Lucy realized that the girl was Margaret.\n\n\"It's Lady Phyler! Everyone must be around here somewhere!\"\n\n\"I don't see any other members... but let's go and check.\"\n\nThey steered their horses towards Margaret.\n\nAs they drew closer, their horses slowed down and came to a stop in front of the girl.\n\nLucy was the first to jump off her horse, followed by Aron and the escort knights.\n\n\"Lady Phyler!\"\n\n\"Student Margaret!\"\n\nMargaret was sitting frozen on the edge of the canyon cliff, staring blankly into the abyss.\n\nLost in thought, she seemed completely oblivious to Aron and Lucy's approach.\n\n\"Lady Phyler! Snap out of it!!\"\n\nLucy shook Margaret's shoulder, pulling her back to reality.\n\nMargaret finally reacted, her eyes widening as she saw the people who had suddenly appeared.\n\n\"Your Highness...? And Professor Aaron...?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's us, Student Margaret.\"\n\n\"What are you two doing here...?\"\n\n\"We came as soon as we confirmed that Group 4's communication had been cut off. Where are the other members?\"\n\nAron asked, looking around and confirming that Margaret was alone.\n\nMargaret trembled as she lowered her head in response.\n\n\"Student Margaret...?\"\n\n\"...We were... attacked.\"\n\nThe words that escaped the girl's lips were nothing short of shocking.\n\n\"Attacked?!\"\n\n\"Damn it, I knew it... Did you see who it was?\"\n\nAron, who had already suspected as much, calmly asked for further explanation.\n\nHowever, Margaret's answer startled even him.\n\n\"Undead... Undead Knight.\"\n\n\"Undead...?\"\n\nAron frowned at Margaret's words.\n\nUndead?\n\nHe hadn't sensed any trace of magical energy like that.\n\nAron realized that the situation might be even more serious than they had anticipated.\n\n\"Please tell us what happened in detail.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nMargaret remained silent.\n\nUnable to bear it any longer, Lucy, who had been listening to their conversation, interjected.\n\n\"What about Raiden... I mean, Young Master Lishite? Is he with the rest of the group?\"\n\nAt the mention of the name \"Raiden,\" Margaret's face turned deathly pale.\n\n\"Y-Young Master Lishite is...\"\n\nHer fingertips trembled.\n\nHer crimson eyes lost their light, and her hands were clenched into fists so tight that her knuckles turned white.\n\nSeeing Margaret's unusual behavior, Lucy had a sinking feeling that something was terribly wrong.\n\nAnd unfortunately, her intuition proved to be accurate.\n\n\"He's... dead...\"\n\nMargaret's confession was followed by Lucy's stunned mutter.\n\n\"What...?\"\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Bonus chapter thanks to ADXDXDXD boosting our discord server!Sorrow and the Undead Knights (3)\n\nThrough Margaret, Lucy and Aron were able to grasp the current situation.\n\nThe attack by the unidentified undead knights.\n\nThe death of Lucas, the senior professor who had gone missing.\n\nThe scattered party members.\n\nAnd lastly... the death of Raiden Lishite.\n\nThe two, who had just heard the story from Margaret, were speechless with shock.\n\n\"...Raiden, is dead?\"\n\n\"...Lucas is?\"\n\nEach uttered a single word, their voices hollow.\n\nTheir small murmurs were carried away by the autumn wind and scattered into nothingness.\n\nThe fragments wandered aimlessly through the air before returning to their mouths, leaving a bitter taste.\n\n\"N-no way... That can't be...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nLucy's voice trembled as she denied Margaret's words.\n\nAron was darkly silent.\n\nMargaret stared at them with vacant eyes.\n\nAmidst the chaos, it was Aron who pulled himself together first.\n\nHe took a few deep breaths, roughly wiping his face, and regained his composure.\n\n\"First, let's organize the information. It seems Professor Lucas' death is certain.\"\n\nThe way he calmly accepted the news of his longtime colleague's death was nothing short of professional.\n\nAron, his gaze fixed on Margaret, continued to confirm the facts.\n\n\"The remaining party members, Golden Boy and Violet are missing... and Raiden is presumed dead. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"...Yes.\"\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nAron stroked his chin, groaning.\n\nCountless thoughts raced through his mind.\n\nLucas, the strongest among the Academy professors after the headmistress, was dead.\n\nAnd three students were missing.\n\nAron had to make a decision.\n\nShould he search for the remaining students?\n\nOr should he return to base camp safely, leaving them behind?\n\nConsidering Lucy and Margaret, who were beside him, the latter seemed like the right choice.\n\nIt would be much safer to return the two students safely and then search for the others with the Academy's support.\n\n'But... it'll take too much time.'\n\nIn this situation, time was of the essence.\n\nEven a slight delay could mean death for those who needed rescuing.\n\nThere was also the option of sending the two students back with the escort knights and continuing the search alone, but that was too risky.\n\nJudging from Lucas' death, the enemy was a formidable opponent.\n\nEven if he could find the students on his own, it would be pointless if he couldn't protect them.\n\nUltimately, he had to choose one of the two options.\n\n'The guaranteed safety of the students with me now, or the uncertain safety of the students in danger...'\n\nAron weighed the gravity of both choices and sighed, his head pounding.\n\nHe decided to give the decision to those directly involved.\n\n\"Your Highness, Student Margaret. I need your attention for a moment.\"\n\nAron's heavy voice drew their attention.\n\nHe met their gazes, one red and one blue, and explained his thoughts.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nLucy and Margaret listened to Aron's words with vacant expressions.\n\nSeeing their unfocused eyes, Aron wondered if they were even listening, but he brushed the thought aside.\n\nFortunately, as he finished, Margaret, her eyes brimming with tears, spoke up.\n\n\"We have to... find the others...\"\n\nLucy nodded in agreement.\n\n\"What if... Raiden is still alive...? We have to search...\"\n\nAron nodded at the girls' resolute answer.\n\n\"I understand. Then let's depart immediately.\"\n\nLucy and Margaret had made their choice.\n\nEven if it was a decision driven by a momentary sense of guilt or a sliver of hope.\n\nAron decided to respect their wishes.\n\n-Wheeiiiik!\n\nAron whistled loudly, calling for the horses resting in the distance.\n\nHe explained the rough search route as he grabbed the reins of the approaching horses.\n\nAt that moment.\n\n\"We'll follow the canyon first, then head downstream...\"\n\n-Kwaaaaaang!!\n\nA deafening roar shook the entire forest.\n\nThe three turned their heads in alarm towards the source of the sound.\n\nTheir eyes fell upon the edge of the forest, downstream of the Mutan River.\n\n-Bang! Bang! Bang!\n\nThe booming continued, echoing through the air.\n\nIt sounded like something was clashing violently.\n\n\"...It seems we need to alter our route.\"\n\nAron muttered to himself as he mounted his horse.\n\n***\n\n-Clang, Clank...! Thud!!\n\nI forcefully pushed back the sword that had been locked with mine in a contest of strength.\n\nThe force of the movement threw me off balance, and my step faltered for a split second.\n\nIn that instant, two sword strikes came hurtling towards me, their timing impeccable.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, several arrows came flying from behind, aiming for my blind spot.\n\n-Shheeeek!!\n\nRealizing there was no escape, I reluctantly used up one of my precious Blink charges.\n\n\"Blink.\"\n\n-Crackle!\n\nMy vision blacked out for a moment, and as it returned, I saw arrows peppering the spot where I had been standing.\n\nWhat the hell, is that a shotgun or something?\n\nHow does he fire seven arrows with a single pull?\n\nAs I marveled at the archer's insane skill, I heard the sound of wind rushing towards me from behind.\n\nMy Extrasensory told me it was the sound of a greatsword slicing through the air.\n\nI quickly ducked forward.\n\n-Kwaaaaaaaaaang!!!\n\nThe greatsword missed its target and slammed into the ground, pulverizing the once-solid earth.\n\n\"Holy shit...!\"\n\nEven with the 'Iron Body' effect, that thing would turn me into mincemeat if it connected.\n\nI put some distance between myself and the greatsword-wielder, spitting out a mouthful of blood.\n\n\"Gah, ugh...\"\n\nThese bastards had suddenly gotten serious.\n\nTo be precise, they had changed their tune after I cut down the seventh knight.\n\nThey must have finally realized I was a threat and started fighting seriously.\n\n'This is going to be hell...'\n\nI clicked my tongue as I deflected the attacks raining down on me from all sides.\n\nA well-coordinated formation.\n\nSharp attacks piercing through my defenses.\n\nFollowed by heavy, relentless combos.\n\nThey were truly formidable opponents.\n\n'I should have taken out as many as possible while they were still underestimating me...'\n\nI swallowed my fleeting regret and picked up the pace.\n\nWith every step, my body accelerated, the sound of air being ripped apart echoing around me.\n\nI became a black whirlwind, my blue aura trailing behind like afterimages.\n\nI unleashed my momentum and swung Sorrow at the two knights charging towards me head-on.\n\n-Clang...!!\n\nThe sound of metal clashing against metal reverberated through the air, sparks flying from the point of contact.\n\nMy ears, numb from the intense cacophony, were filled with a high-pitched ringing.\n\n\"Get off me!!\"\n\nI forcefully parried their relentless attacks and focused on pressuring one of them.\n\nHis stance began to crumble.\n\nAs I gained the upper hand, the other knights who had been lagging behind joined the fray.\n\n-Thump, Thump...!\n\nThe heavy footsteps of the greatsword-wielder echoed behind me.\n\nMy instincts screamed that a deadly attack was imminent.\n\nI grabbed the armor of the knight I was facing and flipped him over me.\n\nThe next moment, I threw myself to the side.\n\n-Kwaaaaaaaaaaaang!!!\n\nThe greatsword crashed down on the head of the knight I had just thrown, turning him into a pulp.\n\nBits and pieces of his body splattered across the ground, some landing on my boots.\n\nI took a deep breath, frowning.\n\n'I really can't afford to get hit by that.'\n\nI pushed myself off the ground and continued my dance of death with the remaining knights.\n\n-Crack, Kgggh...! Clang, Thud!!\n\nAgainst the crimson backdrop of falling leaves, my swordsmanship became a storm, scattering the flower petals of death.\n\nBlue lines crisscrossed the air, leaving trails of shimmering light.\n\nMy azure strikes delivered death once more to those who had already tasted it.\n\n\"Haa...!\"\n\nI lunged forward and slammed a low kick into the thigh of the greatsword-wielder, who was trying to force his way through.\n\nThe impact of my kick, as powerful as a whip, caved in his armor, the sound of bones shattering reaching my ears.\n\nHe lost his balance and stumbled.\n\nSorrow, seizing the opportunity, sliced clean through his neck.\n\n-Slice!\n\nWith a single, clean cut, the giant's body crumpled to the ground, crushing the other knights behind him.\n\nI plunged my sword into the chests of the knights who were struggling under the weight of their from a comrade.\n\n\"Haa... Haa...\"\n\nI was out of breath.\n\nEven with the 'Iron Body' effect, my exhausted body was nearing its limit.\n\nAs much as I wanted to collapse then and there, three enemies still remained.\n\n\"Tsk...\"\n\nI clicked my tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood, mixed with fragments of broken teeth.\n\n\"This is... This is fucking exhausting...\"\n\nI cursed under my breath, trying to steady my wavering vision.\n\nThe sight of the remaining undead filled me with disgust.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Yeah, this is my life now... A moment of peace, and then this shit happens.\"\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\nA quick glance at my status window told me that I had about 2 minutes of Extrasensory left.\n\nIt was time to end this.\n\n\"Let's finish this, quickly.\"\n\nI muttered, my voice weak, and raised my sword, pointing it at the knight who seemed to be the leader.\n\n\"I'll send you all back to hell.\"\n\nWith that, I chanted.\n\n\"Blink × 4.\"\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Haa...\"\n\nA black-haired boy gasped for breath, his face etched with exhaustion.\n\nHis name was Raiden Lishite.\n\nIt was me.\n\n\"...It's finally over.\"\n\nI muttered, wiping the sticky, dark blood from my hands.\n\nWith a numb arm, I sheathed Sorrow, which had fallen to the ground.\n\n-Click...\n\nAs Sorrow was sealed, the blue aura that had been flickering around me dissipated into the air.\n\nI watched as the remnants of light faded away, leaving behind faint afterimages, and then I looked around.\n\nAt my feet lay the mangled corpses of the black knights.\n\nOnly then did the reality of the situation fully sink in.\n\nThe battle was over.\n\nMy tense muscles relaxed, and I leaned back against the tree.\n\n\"That was close...\"\n\nI had managed to finish the fight with just seconds to spare before my Extrasensory ran out.\n\nIf those bastards had stalled for even a little longer...\n\nI would be the one lying dead on the ground right now.\n\nI shuddered at the thought.\n\nI let out a small sigh and knocked on the tree trunk behind me.\n\n\"I survived again, huh?\"\n\nTwo sleepless nights.\n\nMy mind and body were pushed to their absolute limits, and I had just gone through a grueling battle against a horde of undead.\n\nEvery muscle in my body ached.\n\nNo, it wasn't just my muscles.\n\nMy entire body was a mess.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nI groaned as I struggled to my feet.\n\nA wave of pain shot through my body, making me want to collapse again.\n\nBut I had to keep going.\n\nIt wasn't over yet.\n\nI had counted twenty undead knights earlier.\n\nI had just taken care of thirteen, which meant seven remained.\n\n\"Those remaining bastards are probably...\"\n\nChasing after Golden Boy and Violet.\n\nDamn it, I hope those guys managed to get away safely.\n\nI limped forward, my leg throbbing with pain.\n\nI wasn't sure what I could even do in this state...\n\nBut I couldn't just sit here and wait for death.\n\n\"Huu...\"\n\nI took a shallow breath and started walking.\n\nThat's when I heard it.\n\n-Heeeeeiiiing!\n\nThe sound of powerful hooves pounding against the ground reached my ears from behind.\n\n\"......?\"\n\nI tilted my head, turning around at the sound.\n\nHorses? What the...?\n\nThe undead wouldn't be riding horses, and Golden Boy and Violet should be heading towards the camp...\n\nReinforcements?

And me...?'\n\nAs I stared at the strange pair, their faces blank, they spoke.\n\n- Don't forget.\n\n- That we are not so different.\n\nThe two boys smiled faintly.\n\nAnd then, they faded back into the darkness.\n\nI tried to reach out to them, questions swirling in my mind, but my hand passed through empty space.\n\nOnly their words lingered, echoing in the silence.\n\n- Snap...\n\nMy vision went dark once more.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, I was lying in a large bed.\n\n\"......\"\n\nMy mind felt groggy as if I had just woken from a deep sleep.\n\nI blinked slowly, taking in my surroundings.\n\nI was in the makeshift infirmary at the base camp.\n\n\"......I'm alive.\"\n\nI muttered, my hand instinctively reaching for my abdomen.\n\nInstead of three gaping wounds, I felt thick bandages.\n\nThey had managed to treat me in time.\n\nAs I let out a sigh of relief and sank back into the pillows, I heard familiar voices from beside me.\n\n\"Ra-Raiden...!?\"\n\n\"You're...?\"\n\nI turned my head to see Lucy and Margaret, their faces pale with worry.\n\nTheir eyes were fixed on me, and soon, tears welled up in their eyes.\n\nWhat's with them...?\n\nI was taken aback by their reaction, but I managed to greet them with an awkward,\n\n\"Good... morning?\"\n\nLucy, who had been biting her lip, burst into tears and threw her arms around me.\n\n\"Raiden...!!\"\n\n\"Oof?!

Maniac!”\n\n“Y-Young Master Lishite…!”\n\nI looked up to see Golden Boy and Violet approaching.\n\n“Golden Boy… and Violet?” I muttered, recognizing the two figures.\n\n“Well, well! Look who’s still alive! You’re a tough one, aren’t you?”\n\n“You sound almost disappointed.”\n\n“Am I that transparent?”\n\nThis bastard…\n\nI shot him a tired glare and raised my fist playfully.\n\nGolden Boy immediately ducked behind Violet, hiding like a scared puppy.\n\n“Hey, hey… Cut me some slack, will ya? I’m technically still injured, you know?”\n\nPeeking out from behind Violet, he gestured towards his bandaged body with a sheepish grin.\n\n“If Violet hadn’t brought Professor Kate along… I might actually be dead right now.”\n\n“You wish.”\n\n“Wow… You’re so mean.”\n\nGolden Boy pouted at my blunt reply.\n\nIgnoring his dramatics, I turned to Violet, who had been unusually quiet.\n\n“S-So, I, I heard you had surgery… Are, are you alright?” she stammered, her voice filled with concern.\n\nI couldn’t help but smile at her earnestness.\n\n“I’m fine… How about you?”\n\n“O-Oh…! I-I’m alright… thanks to Golden Boy… he protected me…!”\n\n“Ahem!”\n\nGolden Boy puffed out his chest and pretended to cough, trying to hide his smug grin.\n\nI had half a mind to wipe that self-satisfied look off his face with a good punch.\n\nWhat was that? A new signal for “hit me”?\n\n“See that? That’s how awesome your bro is.”\n\n“...”\n\n“One flick of my finger and those enemies were dropping like flies! Just like the hero in a novel…”\n\nI tuned out Golden Boy’s rambling, letting his words flow in one ear and out the other.\n\nTurning back to Violet, I noticed something out of place.\n\n“What, what is it…?” she asked, her voice small and uncertain, as if sensing my gaze.\n\nI tapped my cheek lightly.\n\n“Your bandage is coming loose.”\n\n“My… My bandage?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nViolet’s hand flew to her cheek, and her eyes widened in alarm as she felt the loose bandage.\n\nShe quickly adjusted it, her movements frantic.\n\nI let out a small sigh.\n\n“Be careful.”\n\n“T-Thank you…”\n\nI reached out and ruffled her hair gently.\n\nShe flinched slightly at my touch, but I pretended not to notice.\n\n“So… are we heading back to the Academy tomorrow morning?”\n\n“Yeah, probably. There’s no reason for us to stay here any longer.”\n\n“I just want to go back and sleep for a week straight…”\n\nGolden Boy chuckled at my tired sigh.\n\n“Come on, it wasn’t that bad, was it? The first day was pretty exciting, actually.”\n\n“I guess you could say that.”\n\n“What’s with the dull response?”\n\nI didn’t bother answering.\n\nI was exhausted.\n\nThis school trip had been anything but relaxing.\n\nI ran a hand over my face, trying to rub away the fatigue.\n\n“Why don’t we get some rest for now?” Golden Boy suggested, his voice unusually gentle. “Your wounds probably haven’t fully healed yet.”\n\nI considered his words for a moment, then nodded slowly.\n\n“...Yeah, you’re right.”\n\nHe was right.\n\nI had a lot to think about, but for now, I just needed to rest.\n\nWe’d be heading back to the Academy tomorrow, anyway.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

One of the Four Heavenly Kings, Pyren.\n\nThat was the old man's true identity.\n\n\"Hmm...?\"\n\nPyren, who had been sitting still with his eyes closed, suddenly let out a questioning sound.\n\nWith an intrigued expression, he muttered to himself,\n\n\"Oh?

Squelch!\n\nWith a grotesque sound, a face began to form from the gore.\n\nBefore long, Craxious, fully restored to his original form, stood up from the floor, brushing off the blood from his sleeve.\n\n\"Misjudged your strength, my ass. You did that on purpose.\"\n\n\"Well, you could have phrased your question a little more politely.\"\n\n\"Damn you.\"\n\nCraxious glared at Pyren, who was smiling mischievously, and let out a sigh.\n\n\"Anyway… What were you saying earlier?

I guess we'll have to start training again.\n\n-Should we stop recording here for today?\n\n-Well, we can do it again next month...\n\nAnd the video ended.\n\nI stared at the screen, a hollow feeling lingering in my chest.\n\nThe green-haired young man no longer existed there.\n\nAll that remained was a blacked-out screen.\n\nA heavy silence hung in the air.\n\nThe professors were covering their faces with their heads bowed.\n\nGolden Boy, who was standing next to me, also kept his mouth shut, as if reminiscing about something.\n\nOnly the dreary sound of rain echoed around us.\n\n\"I'll miss him... He was a good man.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nI couldn't bring myself to respond to Golden Boy's murmur.\n\nI didn't think I had the right.\n\nMy eyes stinging, I straightened my posture.\n\n\"Lastly... let us offer flowers to him who has left us.\"\n\n\"May he find peace among the stars.\"\n\nSharon stepped down from the podium after reciting the last sentence of the eulogy.\n\nAnd then, she laid down a single chrysanthemum in front of the lonely tombstone.\n\nOne by one, the other professors followed suit and laid down their flowers.\n\nThe procession of that heavy scent continued for a long time, making me dizzy.\n\nAs I struggled to hold onto my wavering consciousness, my turn came.\n\nA bouquet of white carnations was placed in my hand.\n\nWith heavy steps, I faced the tombstone.\n\n-Hello, Student Raiden.\n\n-It might be a little difficult... but would you like to learn?\n\n-Well then, let's get along. You'll keep coming to learn from me, right?\n\nIf only I had refused your offer back then at the training ground.\n\nI wouldn't be feeling this regret now.\n\nI pulled myself together and slowly laid down the bouquet.\n\nA thought crossed my mind.\n\nWhat should I say to you as you depart?\n\nI stood there for a moment, frozen, then finally parted my lips with difficulty.\n\n\"Thank you for everything.\"\n\nA trembling sentence escaped my throat.\n\n\"...Master.\"\n\nOnly at the very last moment could I finally bring myself to call him Master.\n\n.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Bonus chapter thanks to '@readercord' for subscription to 'Sorrow' tier  on Ko-fi.Legacy.\n\nSwords of the Stars.\n\nThe knight order is known as humanity's strongest.\n\nThe thought that they only had twelve members might make them seem small, but their force was comparable to the Imperial Knights.\n\nEach member was a genius, the likes of which were only born once a generation.\n\nEspecially their leader, Gillius. He possessed such overwhelming power that he could compete with Korn for the position of the strongest in the world.\n\nIn the original story, they often appeared before Allen had fully awakened.\n\nThey served as a deus ex machina, providing aid whenever the protagonists encountered insurmountable foes.\n\nThey saved Allen from a brutal beating at the hands of one of the Four Heavenly Kings' Pryen.\n\nThey sliced through the Seeker's headquarters like tofu, allowing the kidnapped students to escape.\n\nExcluding the Demon King and the Four Heavenly Kings, they were practically unrivaled in their might.\n\nWhenever the Swords of the Stars appeared in the original story, I felt a sense of relief wash over me.\n\nThe problem was...\n\n“...Please, raise your head, Sir Crayden.”\n\nThe leader of those incredible individuals was bowing his head to me.\n\nI bit my lip, feeling an immense weight settle upon my shoulders.\n\nFortunately, Gillias straightened his posture after a brief moment, but the gazes of those around us remained fixated.\n\nI swallowed, trying to quench the sudden dryness in my throat.\n\nSword Star. A being capable of splitting mountains and seas in half with a single strike.\n\nThe pressure emanating from him was like nothing I had ever experienced, making it difficult to even speak.\n\n“...”\n\nNo, perhaps I had felt something like this before.\n\nThis feeling of being completely overwhelmed.\n\nIt was similar to the pressure I felt in my previous life when I faced my opponent in the World Championship finals.\n\nThe opponent who had utterly crushed me, 10-0.\n\nI couldn’t recall his name, but the feeling was eerily similar.\n\nAs I drifted down memory lane, Gillius, who had been staring down at me, finally spoke.\n\n“You are an interesting one.”\n\n“Uh… P-pardon?”\n\nI almost bit my tongue in surprise, but I managed to recover smoothly.\n\nGillius didn't seem to mind my slip-up.\n\n“Most people would be frozen stiff in your position, unable to move under my aura. Like those people over there.”\n\nGillius gestured towards a group of students who stood frozen in place.\n\nTheir eyes were wide with fear as they stared in our direction.\n\nGillius continued, his gaze fixed on them.\n\n“That reaction is to be expected.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“Yet, you seem perfectly composed. There's a spark in your eyes.”\n\n“Huh…?”\n\nThat’s when I realized something was strange.\n\nWhy wasn’t I affected by his pressure?\n\nThe professors were powerful enough to withstand his aura, but I wasn't anywhere near their level yet…\n\nAs I pondered this, a familiar mechanical sound rang in my ears.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The skill 'Iron Will' mitigates the effects of status ailments (Fear, Submission, Incapacitation… and 3 others).]\n\nA blue window popped up in front of me, displaying the notification.\n\nI frowned at the message.\n\nSo, it could even block passive effects like this?\n\nI had a hunch about this ever since it blocked the ‘Curse of Loneliness’ on Violet.\n\nIt seemed like Iron Will was a much more useful skill than I initially thought.\n\n“You possess a strong will, despite your appearance.”\n\n“...Thank you.”\n\n“Well… you are Lucas's disciple, after all.”\n\nGillius nodded in understanding as if that explained everything.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, I cautiously spoke up, finally voicing the question that had been on my mind.\n\n“Sir Crayden… if you don’t mind me asking, are you related to my master by any chance…?”\n\n“Hmm? We fought side-by-side in the past, but we are not blood-related.”\n\n“Then why do you share the same last name…?”\n\n“Ah, I suppose you wouldn't know.”\n\nGillius seemed to understand my confusion.\n\nHe chuckled softly and gestured towards the knights standing behind him.\n\n“All of my knights bear the name Crayden.”\n\n“Crayden… it’s a name bestowed upon those who serve under you?”\n\n“To be precise, it’s a name I bestow. Most of those who have served by my side have taken the name Crayden.”\n\n“So, my master as well…?”\n\n“Yes, Lucas spent some time with me… though he decided to become a professor after the war ended.”\n\nGillias scratched the back of his head, letting out a sigh.\n\nHe gazed towards the tombstone, a wistful expression on his face. Then, he turned back to me.\n\n“Well, I suppose this is goodbye for now… I should be on my way.”\n\n“What? You’re leaving already?”\n\n“My purpose for coming here today was to see what Lucas left behind.”\n\nGillius’s gaze swept over the crowd, lingering on the faces of the students and professors who mourned master’s passing.\n\nHis eyes finally settled on the gray tombstone that stood at the center of the field. A sad smile touched his lips.\n\n“So, this is what he left behind.”\n\n“...”\n\n“That arrogant bastard. He lived a fulfilling life, even if it meant defying me to the very end.”\n\nGillius looked at me one last time, his blue eyes filled with an emotion I couldn’t decipher.\n\nHe patted my shoulder lightly and turned to leave, his knights following closely behind.\n\n“Until we meet again, Young Master. If fate allows it.”\n\nI watched silently as Gillius walked away, his red robe billowing behind him like a cape.\n\n***\n\nThe Swords of the Stars, who had swept through like a storm, left the funeral, leaving Raiden standing dazedly in the rain-soaked field.\n\nA little distance away, another boy was observing him.\n\n“...Something’s definitely strange.”\n\nThe boy, who muttered these words with a frown on his dazzling, golden eyes, was Allen Reinhardt.\n\nThe chosen hero of this generation.\n\nStanding beside him was Lorraine, the next Saintess of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n“Mr. Allen…? What do you mean by strange?”\n\nLorraine tilted her head, looking at Allen with a puzzled expression.\n\nThe boy seemed off.\n\nHis body was stiff, and beads of sweat were dripping from his forehead.\n\nIt was a stark contrast to his usual composed demeanor.\n\nShe was worried that he might be feeling unwell, but Allen didn’t seem to hear her.\n\n“...”\n\nAllen was currently experiencing a chilling sense of fear.\n\nHe was someone who had remained calm even when facing the attackers during the banquet hall incident a few months ago.\n\nYet, here he was, his hands trembling.\n\nThe reason was Raiden.\n\nIt was because of the suffocating pressure emanating from the black-haired boy.\n\nIt didn’t seem like others could sense it,\n\nBut Allen, with his hero’s eyes, could see it clearly.\n\nA blue aura was violently swirling around Raiden, threatening to consume everything around him.\n\nOf course, this wasn’t the first time Allen had witnessed this sight, but the intensity was on a different level this time.\n\nIn the past, it was simply a feeling of tension,\n\nBut now, it felt as though he would be devoured if he so much as lowered his guard.\n\nHis survival instincts were screaming at him.\n\n“Mr. Allen, you’re pale… Are you sure you’re alright?”\n\n“...I’m fine.”\n\nAllen replied, unable to tear his gaze away from Raiden.\n\nGillius Crayden is known as humanity’s strongest.\n\nDespite standing next to such an existence, Raiden’s wild power wasn’t suppressed in the slightest.\n\nNo matter how much Allen thought about it, it didn’t make sense.\n\nFor a student who was at the bottom of the Academy until last year to exude such an aura…\n\nThere were too many suspicious things about him.\n\nThe fact that he knew Allen was the hero, the fact that he knew about the banquet hall attack in advance,\n\nAnd the fact that he was always at the center of every incident that occurred.\n\nAllen was beginning to suspect that Raiden was the mastermind behind all the recent events.\n\n‘Could it be that this field trip attack was also…’\n\nHe couldn’t be sure, but Allen thought it was a reasonable assumption.\n\nThe banquet hall attack and the field trip attack.\n\nHe didn’t believe it was a coincidence that the same person was at the center of both incidents.\n\n‘…I need confirmation.’\n\nAllen muttered to himself.\n\nHe decided to call Raiden aside and sound him out.\n\nIf his hypothesis was correct, Raiden would surely react suspiciously.\n\n“A-Allen…! Where are you going…?”\n\n“I’m going to see Young Master Lishite.”\n\n“What…? You mean, Raiden…?”\n\nAllen calmly started walking.\n\nHe felt a flicker of fear as he looked at the boy standing amidst the surging blue light,\n\nBut he steeled his resolve.\n\nHe was the one who shouldered the fate of the hero.\n\nThis was a duty he couldn’t run from.\n\nIf it was a misunderstanding, he would apologize sincerely and back down.\n\nAnd if it wasn’t… he would just have to eliminate him with all his might.\n\nAllen took a deep breath and stopped.\n\nHe was now standing in front of Raiden.\n\n“Young Master Lishite.”\n\n“...Young Master Reinhardt?”\n\n“I have something to discuss with you. Could you spare me a moment?”\n\n“I’m a little tired right now… No, I suppose a moment would be fine.”\n\n“Thank you. Then please follow me. I wish to speak somewhere private.”\n\n“What is it that you wish to discuss…?”\n\nRaiden furrowed his brow but agreed to Allen’s request without resistance.\n\nThe two of them left the funeral grounds and headed for a secluded alleyway.\n\nAfter confirming that there was no one else around, Allen turned to face Raiden.\n\n“Young Master Lishite.”\n\n“Yes… Explain to me why you brought me to such a secluded place.”\n\n“I have something I want to ask you.”\n\n“You do not have permission to question me.”\n\nRaiden’s face was expressionless.\n\nTo break through his facade, Allen decided to cut straight to the chase.\n\n“Did you have something to do with Professor Lucas’s death?”\n\n“...What?”\n\n“I asked if you killed him.”\n\nAllen asked with resolute determination.\n\nThe next moment, the aura that had been surging around Raiden distorted grotesquely.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Please, stop right there!\n\nThat’s right, I remember now.\n\nYou were looking at me with those same eyes back then.\n\nLike a hero facing down a villain.\n\nThe same composition, the same atmosphere.\n\nBut there was one crucial difference.\n\nToday, I wasn't in the mood to tolerate your naivete.\n\nI could feel my self-control slipping away.\n\n“Answer me!” Allen demanded.\n\n“Allen.”\n\n“Answer my ques—!”\n\n“Clench your jaw.”\n\n-Crack!!\n\nThe next moment, my fist connected with Allen’s face.\n\nA sickening crunch echoed through the alley as his face contorted in pain.\n\nI didn’t stop there.\n\nI swept his legs out from under him, sending him crashing to the ground.\n\n“Ugh…?!”\n\nI pinned him down, pressing my knee into his chest to prevent him from struggling.\n\nThen, I slammed my elbow into his jaw.\n\nThe metallic tang of blood filled the air as my hand throbbed with a dull ache.\n\nI continued to pummel him, my expression cold and detached.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\n-Crack, thud! Ugh!\n\n“I should try to understand you, to let this slide… but I just can’t do it today.”\n\n-Thud! Crack!! Crunch…!\n\n“I used to admire you, even cared for you, but now… I don’t know anymore.

Do you think I was too harsh?\n\nRaiden was staring into the empty air, holding a conversation.\n\nAs if someone was actually standing in front of him.\n\nThe girl froze for a moment at the bizarre sight.\n\nAn ordinary person would have been terrified.\n\nThere he was, shrouded in darkness, muttering to himself as if possessed by a ghost.\n\nBut the girl, knowing his past and mental state,\n\nfelt nothing but pity.\n\n'He's hearing hallucinations...'\n\nRaiden had been suffering from hallucinations and delusions.\n\nEver since he witnessed his own mother being murdered right in front of his eyes.\n\nGrief had scarred him, consuming his life, and the pain had broken him.\n\nThe girl's lips trembled slightly.\n\nShe knew about Raiden's pain, of course.\n\nBut this was the first time she had witnessed this side of him so vividly.\n\nReflected in his wavering blue eyes was a lonely boy, carrying a heavy burden on his back.\n\n- I told you, I'm fine.\n\n- You never listen, do you...\n\nRaiden continued his monologue, his eyes unfocused.\n\nHe let out a hollow chuckle, then shook his head.\n\nAs she watched him silently,\n\na cruel sentence suddenly escaped his lips, piercing the girl's heart.\n\n- Yeah, yeah... I'm struggling. I get it, so stop bothering me.\n\nIt was a cry filled with exhaustion.\n\nThe girl felt a pang in her chest.\n\nRaiden was a person who couldn't be honest about his own feelings.\n\nHe wouldn't say he was hurting, even when he was in pain, and wouldn't say he was struggling even when he was having a hard time.\n\nRaiden, who obsessively hid his wounds in front of others, was only now, with his hallucinations by his side, beginning to reveal his true feelings.\n\nThe girl's vision blurred as she watched the pitiful scene.\n\n- Honestly... Allen's words got to me.\n\n- I've had those thoughts before.\n\n- The thought that Master might have died because of me.\n\nThe 'Master' Raiden was referring to was most likely Professor Lucas.\n\nHe was the only faculty member Raiden was close to.\n\nThe girl instinctively knew what Raiden's melancholy was connected to.\n\n- Maybe Allen's right, maybe Master did die because of me.\n\n- I thought I was doing my best.\n\n- Am I really doing okay?\n\n- Could I have saved Master if I had tried harder?\n\nRaiden was blaming himself.\n\nHe was agonizing over the responsibility of his master's tragedy, carrying the weight on his own shoulders.\n\nHe had done his best, but he was tormented by the thought of whether he had been on the right path.\n\nCome to think of it, Raiden had always been like this.\n\nWhen he lost his mother, he blamed himself, believing he was the cause of the tragedy.\n\nEven while suffering from severe mental illness, he was busy pushing himself to the limit, prioritizing others.\n\nRaiden acted as if he was to blame for all the misfortunes in the world.\n\n- Well, I don't know...\n\nHe needed it.\n\nSomeone to tell him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing well enough.\n\nHe needed someone to offer him reassurance as he crumbled under the weight of his anxiety.\n\n- I miss Master… He would have told me I was doing a good job.\n\nA whisper, filled with loneliness, reached her ears.\n\nThe girl couldn't take it anymore and ran out in front of Raiden.\n\nPerhaps due to her overflowing emotions, she was already half in tears.\n\nThe blonde girl... Lucy, her voice trembling, shouted at him.\n\n\"It's not your fault, Raiden...!\"\n\n\"......Your Highness?\"\n\nStartled by her sudden appearance, the boy lifted his head to look at Lucy.\n\nHis lifeless black eyes held only a faint trace of sorrow.\n\n***\n\nMy initial surprise at Lucy's sudden appearance quickly faded.\n\nI made the panting girl sit down on the bench.\n\nHer slender legs were trembling, as if she had been searching for me all day.\n\nShe seemed like she had a lot to say,\n\nbut I gently ignored her for the moment and guided her to the bench.\n\nThe Imperial Princess, running around until her legs gave out?\n\nShe did the same thing during our last school trip.\n\nWhat if she really got hurt…\n\n“You must maintain your composure, Your Highness…”\n\n“......”\n\nLucy bit her lip and didn’t answer my scolding.\n\nIs she upset?\n\nWell… she has every right to be.\n\nIf I hadn’t disappeared from the funeral without a word, Lucy wouldn’t be acting like this.\n\nI chuckled, shaking my head at her stubborn silence.\n\n“Please don’t do this again… And, I apologize for disappearing so suddenly earlier. I had something to attend to.”\n\nLucy still remained silent.\n\nI wondered if she was angry, but her expression suggested otherwise.\n\nShe seemed to be carefully choosing her words.\n\nAs I pondered her serious demeanor, Lucy finally spoke.\n\n“...Raiden.”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness.”\n\n“Do you remember what I just said…?”\n\n“What you just said…?”\n\n“I said it wasn’t your fault.”\n\n“Ah, yes, I remember.”\n\nI didn’t know why she said that, but she definitely did.\n\nIt wasn’t my fault.\n\nLucy took a deep breath after I confirmed, then met my gaze.\n\n“I… I actually overheard you.”\n\n“Pardon?”\n\n“When you were talking to the hallucination, I was nearby.”\n\n“.....?”\n\nHallucination? Talking? What was she talking about?\n\nTaken aback by her unexpected confession, I froze for a moment before realizing her misunderstanding.\n\nShe must have overheard my conversation with the status window.\n\nOf course, from her perspective, I must have seemed out of my mind.\n\nA wry smile touched my lips.\n\nAs I was about to correct her misunderstanding,\n\nLucy continued, cutting off my explanation.\n\n“Your Highness, that was actually…”\n\n“You were blaming yourself, Raiden.”\n\n“…..”\n\nMy mouth closed.\n\nI was going to see how much she had heard, but it was pointless.\n\nLucy seemed to have witnessed everything.\n\nI couldn’t help but let out a small sigh at her firm gaze.\n\n“Raiden.”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness.”\n\n“Do you really think that…? That it was all your fault…?”\n\n“…..”\n\n“Answer me…”\n\n“….I apologize.”\n\nI dodged the question, but it was practically an admission.\n\nTears welled up in her blue eyes as they looked at me.\n\nLucy’s shoulders trembled as if she was trying to hold back her tears, and then she whispered, her voice shaking.\n\n“I… I wish you would be a little kinder to yourself…”\n\n“…..”\n\n“You deserve it.”\n\nWith those trembling words, Lucy grasped my hand tightly.\n\nThe cold autumn air clinging to my fingertips was replaced by her warm touch.\n\n“Think about all the things you’ve accomplished.”\n\nFirst, you saved me from the threat of assassination.\n\nAnd you fought single-handedly against the assassins who attacked the Academy.\n\nDuring the recent school trip attack, you risked your life to save Lady Phyler.\n\nYou fought the undead and survived a near-death experience.\n\n“You saved the lives of countless students in the process… including mine.”\n\nLucy smiled awkwardly, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nLove, trust, and sadness were beautifully intertwined in her glistening tears.\n\n“I don’t want you to burden yourself so much.”\n\nWith that, Lucy turned to face me.\n\nThen, she stretched out her arms and pulled me into a tight embrace.\n\nAs I was caught off guard by the sudden warmth of her hug, a calm whisper reached my ears.\n\n“Y-Your Highness…?”\n\n“Don’t worry. You’re doing well enough.”\n\nIf you did your best, that’s all that matters.\n\nI don’t know if I can ever replace Professor Lucas,\n\nbut lean on me from now on.\n\nWhenever you’re feeling anxious like today, I’ll tell you.\n\n“That you’re doing well…”\n\n“…..”\n\nI couldn’t say a word.\n\nI just stood there, dumbfounded, accepting the warmth she offered.\n\nThe words she had just spoken were organizing themselves in my mind, filling me with a strange sense of comfort.\n\n‘You’re doing well enough.’\n\nIt was a simple sentence,\n\nbut its meaning was far from simple.\n\nWords of encouragement were offered to me, someone who was suffering from anxiety and distrust.\n\nAnd because the speaker was none other than Lucy, those words resonated even more deeply.\n\nLucy von Lietro.\n\nThe girl who survived because I had twisted the original story.\n\nAt the same time, the first person I was able to save by my own choice.\n\nShe, who could be considered a part of my past footsteps, was acknowledging my existence.\n\nShe was telling me that I wasn’t wrong.\n\n“We promised… that we would always be the most precious friends to each other.”\n\nIt was a reminder of a faded memory.\n\nLooking at her smile, which seemed to gently paint a corner of autumn, I felt a lump in my throat.\n\nMy arms were now wrapped around her back.\n\nI whispered in a trembling voice.\n\n“…Thank you.”\n\nIt was a plain expression of gratitude that could have easily been perceived as insincere.\n\nBut this was the best I could do at the moment.\n\nIt was difficult to maintain my composure.\n\nI felt like the expressionless mask I was wearing would shatter if I relaxed even a little.\n\nFortunately, Lucy seemed to understand.\n\nShe gently patted my back with a careful touch.\n\nI closed my eyes for a moment, enveloped by the warmth that spread gently through my body.\n\n“Just rest like this for a bit… I’ll be here.”\n\nI slowly leaned against Lucy.\n\nAnd with a long exhale, I let go of all my strength.\n\nSo much had happened today.\n\nMaster’s funeral, the encounter with Gillius, the conflict with Allen, and now Lucy…\n\nA deep fatigue washed over me.\n\nI didn’t want to think about anything.\n\nRight now, I just…\n\nwanted to rest, embraced by this warmth.\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I'm a little late...\"\n\nHer rich red hair was ruffled by the whipping wind.\n\nEven in the biting chill, her golden eyes stared blankly at the gray tombstone.\n\nThe woman bit her lip silently.\n\nThe woman was none other than Korn Ronezia.\n\nThe headmistress of Reynolds Academy.\n\nAnd the lover of Lucas Crayden, who had now returned to the stars.\n\nKorn, who had been standing still, took out a crystal ball from her bosom.\n\nIt was the record that Lucas had left behind, calling it his last will and testament.\n\nNot the usual video that had been played at the funeral, but a truly serious recording.\n\nIt was a message he had given to Korn, telling her to watch it if he were to die someday.\n\n\"You bad boy... You really made me watch this...\"\n\nKorn couldn't hold back her words of resentment at the welling emotions.\n\nShe quietly moved her fingers to operate the crystal ball.\n\nBefore long, the surface of the crystal ball glowed blue, and a nostalgic voice began to play.\n\n-Hello, Master.\n\n-If you are watching this record... I guess it means I have left the world.\n\nThe green-haired young man who appeared on the screen had a bitter smile on his face.\n\nKorn lowered her head, feeling a lump in her throat.\n\n-I don't know how my end was, but I'll apologize first.\n\n-I wanted to be by your side forever, Master...\n\n-I guess it wasn't meant to be just by wishing.\n\n-Please forgive your incompetent disciple, Master.\n\nThe disciple apologized with a remorseful expression.\n\nHowever, it only made the Master’s heart ache even more.\n\nWhile Korn's vision gradually blurred, Lucas continued his will.\n\n-Still... I think my life was pretty happy.\n\n-There were times when misfortune came, but I overcame it in the end.\n\n-There were so many people I was grateful for.\n\n-Mr. Gillius, whom I met on the battlefield, Young Master Lishite, and the comrades who left the world before me.\n\n-And the fellow professors and students who welcomed me at the academy.\n\n-Lastly......\n\n-My beloved Master.\n\nKorn finally couldn't hold back her tears.\n\nTransparent lines were drawn pitifully across her white cheeks.\n\nLucas smiled mischievously as if he could see right through Korn.\n\n-You're crying, aren't you, Master?\n\n-You're softer than you look.\n\nAt the playful smile of the young man, Korn rubbed her damp eyes.\n\nNevertheless, the downpour that had started once didn't seem to stop.\n\n-I remember the first time I confessed my love to you, Master.\n\n-You yelled at me with a flushed face, 'Don't be ridiculous!'\n\n-Haha...

      "content": ".\n\nExactly five years before Naru's death.\n\nIt had been almost a year since Changho met Naru on the national team and they became like brothers.\n\nRight after finishing another grueling day of training.\n\nChangho was walking lightly, thinking he should go see Naru.\n\nSomeone called out to him.\n\n\"Seo Changho.\"\n\n\"......?\"\n\nChangho turned his head with a questioning look at the familiar voice.\n\nHis face hardened as he saw the man standing there.\n\nA middle-aged man with characteristic black hair and sharp eyes.\n\nA face he hadn't seen in almost six years.\n\nBut it was also a face that brought him no joy.\n\n\"......Senior Hanchul.\"\n\nChangho muttered, staring at the man in front of him.\n\nKim Hanchul.\n\nA legend in the Korean Kendo world, a monster who had won five consecutive world championships.\n\nHe stood at the pinnacle of Korean Kendo history.\n\nHe was the current president of the Korean Kendo Association.\n\nAnd...\n\nNaru's father.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nInside a cafe not far from the training center.\n\nTwo men sat facing each other at a table tucked away in a corner.\n\nA young man with light brown hair and a middle-aged man with black hair.\n\nSeo Changho and Kim Hanchul.\n\n\"So... what brings you here?\"\n\nChangho asked, his eyes cold as he stared at Hanchul.\n\nHis gaze was a mixture of contempt, disgust, and betrayal.\n\nThe eyes of a child who had seen the ugly side of the hero he once admired.\n\n\"It's been a while... About six years, I believe.\"\n\nHanchul greeted him nonchalantly as if he didn't notice Changho's gaze.\n\nChangho felt a surge of nausea at Hanchul's brazen attitude.\n\n\"Yes... It has been a while.\"\n\n\"You don't seem too happy to see me.\"\n\nHanchul said in an emotionless voice, fiddling with the coffee cup on the table.\n\nHe tapped the cup with his index finger and continued.\n\n\"You know why I'm here, don't you?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nChangho kept his mouth shut.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't know why.\n\nHe just didn't want to face it.\n\n\"Did you think I wouldn't know? That you've been close to my son for the past year...\"\n\nThere was an unspoken rule among the members of the training team Changho belonged to.\n\nIt was to keep their distance from the boy named 'Kim Naru'.\n\n-That kid Naru... He's the chairman's son.\n\n-Every senior who got involved with him ended up badly.\n\n-If you show him even a little kindness, or treat him nicely...\n\n-You'll get caught up in some strange violence scandal, or get a weird injury, and be forced to retire...\n\n-So it's best to avoid him as much as possible.\n\nChangho recalled the stories his seniors had told him.\n\n\"You know I've been lenient with you...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Let me be frank. Stay away from my son.\"\n\nChangho didn't answer this time either.\n\nHanchul sighed at Changho's stubborn attitude and stared at him.\n\nHis empty eyes were black and lifeless.\n\n\"Think about your career as an athlete... Do you really want to ruin your entire life because of some petty sentiment?\"\n\nThis is a warning.\n\nA warning to your life.\n\n\"Think carefully.\"\n\nHanchul said, taking another sip of his coffee.\n\nHis casual tone and demeanor made Changho's teeth grind.\n\nHow could a father say such a thing to his own son?\n\nChangho's hand, holding the coffee cup, tightened involuntarily.\n\n-Crack...!\n\nThe disposable cup crumpled under the pressure.\n\nThe spilled contents soaked the young man's hand coldly.\n\nChangho took a deep breath to calm his anger, then spoke.\n\n\"Why are you doing this...?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why are you pushing that poor child so cruelly...!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nHe had thought it was strange.\n\nThe training Naru was receiving was always a little off.\n\nMaking him spar with people using all sorts of strange weapons.\n\nMaking him run the entire marathon course once a week.\n\nBeating him up all day in the name of training.\n\nIt was all strange, far from any normal training method.\n\nIt seemed more like 'torture' than 'training'.\n\nCruel torture filled with malice.\n\nAs if the focus was not on training, but on inflicting pain.\n\n\"What did that child do wrong to deserve this...?\"\n\nAt Changho's question, Hanchul's pupils darkened.\n\nHis eyes, deep black as if ink had melted within them, looked like the night sky without a moon.\n\nHanchul answered coldly.\n\n\"For his own happiness.\"\n\n\"You bastard.\"\n\nChangho spat out a curse without realizing it.\n\nHanchul, unfazed, moved his lifeless eyes.\n\nHe put down his coffee cup and stood up.\n\n\"Make your choice. Continue to be close to my son, or stay away from him.\"\n\nFor your information, I recommend the latter.\n\nI mean it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe rest was obvious.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Changho chose to stay by Naru's side.\n\n-You'll regret it.\n\nHanchul left the cafe with those words.\n\nChangho was left sitting there, staring blankly at the table Hanchul had vacated.\n\nA few months after their meeting, Changho was caught up in a strange violence scandal.\n\n[Shocking! Current National Kendo Team Member Seo Changho Involved in Violence Scandal...]\n\n[Due to the recent incident, the Association has decided to expel Seo Changho from the Kendo world...]\n\n[Current Kendo Association President, Kim Hanchul, expresses his regret over the incident...]\n\nChangho was swept away by the current without a chance to fight back.\n\nHe was thrown out of his place in an instant and had to flee.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"Fuck...\"\n\nLost in thought, Changho let out another curse.\n\nThe empty sound echoed faintly through the empty room.\n\nHe had failed to do anything, become anything, and had crumbled to nothing.\n\n-I... I will stay by Naru's side. I won't let you have your way.\n\nWhat a foolish vow it had been.\n\nA moment of defiance against the hero of his childhood who had disappointed him.\n\nThe recklessness of a young man whose emotions still outweighed his reason.\n\nThe foolish arrogance of believing he could help Naru in that situation.\n\nChangho gritted his teeth and wiped his eyes again.\n\nA powerless voice escaped his trembling lips.\n\n\"Stay by his side my ass... Stupid...\"\n\nThe vow he had made that day had brought about a storm far greater than he could have imagined.\n\nIt had been violent.\n\nOverwhelming.\n\nAnd so cruel that he couldn't even bring himself to rebel.\n\nChangho had eventually been brought to his knees, unable to withstand Hanchul's power.\n\nAs a result, Changho had lost everything he had built.\n\nAnd Naru had been left with an irreparable wound.\n\n\"I shouldn't have run away like that...\"\n\nIf he was going to run away after losing everything.\n\nHe shouldn't have left Naru alone in the locker room that day.\n\nHe should have grabbed his hand and run away with him.\n\nInstead of cowering in fear before that overwhelming influence, he should have done something, anything.\n\nHe had destroyed his own life by his own choice.\n\nHe should have at least protected what he had tried to protect by fighting through the wreckage...\n\n\"It's my fault... If only I had made a better choice that day...\"\n\nThe accumulated guilt formed a painful memory.\n\nAnd that memory-filled a corner of his heart.\n\nNow that Naru had taken his own life, there was nothing Changho could do.\n\nAll he could do was look up at the towering height of his regrets and lick his wounds bitterly.\n\n\"Ugh, ugh...\"\n\nChangho let out a pained groan as tears streamed down his face.\n\nThe summer sun was peeking through the window.\n\nEvery time the warm rays touched his haggard face, a faint warmth brushed against his cheek.\n\nIt was an utterly unpleasant sensation.\n\nChangho reached out and closed the curtains irritably.\n\nThe warm sunlight reminded him of the small boy's hand that had once touched his cheek.\n\nChangho couldn't bear it.\n\nThe sound of cicadas chirping could be heard from outside the window.\n\nThe air was thick with the heat of summer.\n\nIt was as if everything was reminding him of the season.\n\nCome to think of it, it had always been summer.\n\n-Hey! You're Naru, right? I'm your senior! You can call me Hyung Changho!\n\nThe season when I first met you.\n\n-Well then... Goodbye, Naru.\n\nThe season when I left you.\n\n-Naru... committed suicide...?\n\nThe season when you left this world.\n\n\"Fuck... Fuck, fuck, fuck...\"\n\nRaw, unrefined words spilled from his mouth.\n\nHis voice was closer to a wail than a mutter.\n\nIt was an outpouring of emotion.\n\nThe faint chirping of cicadas seemed to mock him.\n\nChangho covered his ears and curled up.\n\nBut summer wouldn't go away.\n\nIt only mercilessly melted away his body, slumped in defeat under its scorching heat.\n\nYes, summer.\n\nAn endless summer.\n\nA cruel, merciless summer that had taken the boy away.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "The Birth of a Hero\n\nA month had passed since the academy field trip attack.\n\nTime had flowed like water, and it was already the new month of December.\n\nThe surrounding scenery had passed from the vividly colorful autumn to a pure white winter.\n\nThe maple leaves, which had boasted a kaleidoscope of colors, had fallen, becoming the last leaves of autumn.\n\nA biting wind blew between the now empty branches.\n\nAnimals burrowed into deep sleep, turning their backs on the cold.\n\nThe season of tranquility that lulled everything to sleep.\n\nA white winter had arrived.\n\n\"It's cold...\"\n\nAs usual, it was morning, and I was headed to the Academy for class.\n\nI was walking leisurely with Ariel to the building where our classroom was located.\n\nMy shoulders trembled from the sudden cold.\n\nRubbing my freezing hands together, I blew on them for warmth.\n\nDamn, I didn't know it would be this cold.\n\nRachel wasn't kidding when she told me to wear winter clothes.\n\nI cursed my past self for ignoring her advice and leaving the dormitory in my transitional clothes with only a cardigan.\n\n\"Are you alright...?\"\n\nAriel, who was walking next to me, looked up at me with concern as I shivered in the cold.\n\n\"Are you very cold?\"\n\n\"Y-yeah, i-it's f-fine...\"\n\nI forced a smile, my jaw trembling.\n\nTo be honest, I felt like I was going to freeze to death.\n\nBut I decided to endure it, considering it my own fault.\n\nAs I stood there, shaking like I had been electrocuted, Ariel let out a small sigh and unwrapped the muffler from around her neck.\n\nThen, she gently reached out and wrapped it around my face.\n\n\"At least wear this.\"\n\nThe muffler, imbued with Ariel's body heat, warmed my cold cheeks.\n\nStartled by the sudden warmth, I asked,\n\n\"What about you? Won't you be cold?\"\n\n\"I don't get cold. Have you forgotten what my specialty is?\"\n\nWith that, Ariel raised a finger and conjured an ice crystal in the air.\n\n\"Once you reach a certain level of ice magic, you become immune to the cold.\"\n\n\"That's... amazing. I've never heard of that before.\"\n\n\"See? Isn't it cool?\"\n\nI nodded at Ariel, who asked proudly.\n\nIce mages don't feel the cold.\n\nI guess it's similar to how fire mages don't get burned by embers.\n\nAs I was lost in thought, fiddling with the muffler, Ariel puffed out her cheeks and nudged me with her elbow.\n\n\"Seriously, why did you insist on wearing transitional clothes? Rachel even packed your winter uniform this morning.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd be fine until the end of the month...\"\n\n\"Honestly! Just listen to Rachel next time.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes...\"\n\nI lowered my head, feeling ashamed at Ariel's sharp rebuke.\n\nFor some reason, it felt like everyone had been nagging me lately.\n\nStarting with Rachel... then Ariel, the status window, and recently, even Lucy.\n\nMaybe I'm just not that reliable.\n\nI smiled bitterly and scratched my head.\n\nAs we continued our noisy journey to the Academy, I heard a familiar shout from behind.\n\n\"Woohoo~! Found the Maniac!\"\n\nA frivolous tone and a playful voice.\n\nAnd the audacity to call me 'Maniac' so casually.\n\nAs far as I knew, there was only one idiot in the academy... no, in the entire continent who would do that.\n\n\"Golden Boy.\"\n\nTurning around, I saw a certain blonde, tanned idiot walking towards me.\n\nHe was waving his arms as he approached, with not a single ounce of dignity.\n\n\"Another! Energetic!! And strong!!! Morning!!!!\"\n\nGolden Boy greeted me boisterously, full of energy despite the early hour.\n\nI stared at him with a bored expression.\n\n\"......Can't you greet me like a normal person?\"\n\n\"Nope! Don't like it? Just cover your ears!\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nRight, screw it.\n\nWhy am I even trying to have a conversation with you?\n\nI massaged my throbbing temples and let out a deep sigh.\n\nPerhaps intrigued by my resigned reaction, Ariel peeked over at Golden Boy.\n\n\"Um, who are you...?\"\n\n\"Oh? And who might this young lady be...?\"\n\nGolden Boy tilted his head, seemingly unfamiliar with Ariel's face.\n\nBut then, as if he had remembered something, he snapped his fingers.\n\n\"Aha, Lady Lishite! I've heard a lot about you from the Maniac himself.\"\n\n\"You know me...?\"\n\n\"I've heard many things... Well, actually, he just kept saying how cute you are and didn't tell me anything else.\"\n\n\"Huh...?\"\n\nAriel blinked at Golden Boy's words, then her face turned bright red and she pinched my back.\n\n\"Why would you go around saying things like that about me...!\"\n\n\"It felt like I was hearing about how great his little sister is at least once a day.\"\n\n\"U-ugh...!!\"\n\nAriel's face was now as red as a ripe tomato.\n\nShe must be really embarrassed.\n\nThere was only one thing I could say to her.\n\n\"I was just stating facts.\"\n\n\"Agh! You're unbelievable!!\"\n\nAriel seemed to like my answer, as she became even more flustered and tried to bite my arm.\n\nOf course, it didn't hurt.\n\nA mage with zero-strength stat couldn't possibly hurt me.\n\nYou lose, Ariel.\n\n.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": ".\n\nAfter a while, Ariel finally left for her own class, still grumbling under her breath.\n\nGolden Boy and I, now alone, headed towards the Second Annex.\n\nAs we walked along the path, the chilly air settling around us, I fiddled with the muffler Ariel had given me.\n\nAriel seemed really upset.\n\nI wonder how long she'll stay mad this time.\n\nHopefully, she'll have calmed down by dinner.\n\nLost in thought about Ariel, I didn't notice Golden Boy calling out to me.\n\n\"Oh, right. Did you see this?\"\n\nHe pulled something out and waved it in front of me.\n\nIt was a bundle of dark gray papers.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Newspaper articles about the academy field trip attack.\"\n\n\"Hmm...? Isn't that old news? I think I read about it a fortnight ago.\"\n\nGolden Boy shook his head.\n\n\"Back then, they just reported that 'a tragedy occurred' without any details.\"\n\n\"So they're releasing the details now?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nWell, it has been a while.\n\nI guess it's time for the information that couldn't be released before to be made public.\n\n\"Let me see.\"\n\n\"Here. Start reading from the fifth page.\"\n\nTaking the newspaper from him, I began to read slowly.\n\nUnlike the vague articles from a fortnight ago, these ones were filled with specific details.\n\nThere was no sign of propaganda or fabrication, and the information seemed accurate.\n\nBut there was something strange about it.\n\n[Raiden Lishite, eldest son of house Lishite, saves the Academy from attack!]\n\n[His second heroic act following the recent attempted assassination of the Imperial Princesses.]\n\n[Has a new Hero emerged in these tumultuous times?!]\n\nWhat the...\n\nI mean, it's all true, but...\n\nIt's just... strangely...\n\n\"These articles are awfully favorable, don't you think?\"\n\n\"......I'd say they're more than just awfully favorable. They're blatantly biased.\"\n\nI frowned.\n\nIt was as if the newspaper staff had gone insane.\n\nThe people who used to praise Raiden's mischievous deeds were now suddenly changing their tone.\n\nThere were even parts that seemed deliberately exaggerated.\n\nAs I pondered over this with a growing sense of unease, Golden Boy smirked and spoke.\n\n\"Looks like the Academy put some pressure on the newspapers.\"\n\n\"The Academy...?\"\n\nWhy would the Academy suddenly get involved?\n\nI looked at Golden Boy with a puzzled expression.\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"You know... two major incidents in the span of just three months?\"\n\n\"The banquet hall attack and the academy field trip attack...\"\n\n\"Right. Those two. And the scale of those incidents was huge.\"\n\n'Huge' might even be an understatement.\n\nThe first incident involved an attempt to assassinate the Imperial Princesses and the next Saintess of the Holy Kingdom.\n\nIn the second incident, a professor from the Academy was killed.\n\nNot to mention, many students were almost harmed.\n\nAnd all of this happened at Reynolds Academy, the most prestigious educational institution on the continent, in just three months.\n\n\"With things like this happening, people are starting to talk.\"\n\n\"So the public is starting to doubt the Academy's ability to handle these situations.\"\n\n\"Exactly! So, wanna take a guess? How do you think the Academy decided to fix this mess?\"\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nI stroked my chin, considering his question.\n\nWhat solution did the Academy come up with?\n\nCovering up the incidents was not an option.\n\nThere were too many witnesses, and the scale of the incidents was too large to hide.\n\nAdmitting their mistakes wasn't a viable option either.\n\nIt would deal a significant blow to Reynolds Academy's reputation, and they had too much to lose.\n\nThe most likely solution was...\n\n\"To divert attention. Away from the incidents.\"\n\nThe Academy had placed me in the position of a hero.\n\nSo that people would focus on the 'birth of a hero' rather than the 'incidents'.\n\n\"So they're trying to silence the criticism by making me the center of attention.\"\n\nIt was a classic tactic, but not a bad one.\n\nBy throwing in such a sensational element, it would be easier to divert the public's attention.\n\nAnd since the actual damage was minimal despite the scale of the incidents, it was a feasible strategy.\n\n\"Correct again. You're pretty sharp when you want to be.\"\n\nGolden Boy gave me a thumbs-up and spread out his newspaper.\n\n[The Maniac Young Master, Reformed?]\n\n[Getting to Know Raiden Lishite.]\n\n[House Lishite: The Undisputed Top Family Protecting the Empire.]\n\nHe pointed at each of the articles about me and added,\n\n\"See? You really are the best at attracting attention.\"\n\n\"You're one of the most famous nobles in the Empire, after all.\n\nEven if it's for all the wrong reasons...\n\nAnyway, you're perfect for grabbing the public's attention.\n\nAnd you never really respond to public opinion or newspaper articles, do you?\"\n\n\"It must have made it even easier for the Academy to use you.\"\n\n\"Ha.\"\n\nI let out a small laugh.\n\n\"They're quite cunning... Well, that's probably how they've managed to remain the top educational institution for almost a century.\"\n\n\"Aren't you angry? They're using you, after all.\"\n\n\"There are some benefits to it.\"\n\nThey were turning around my negative public image.\n\nIt wasn't entirely a loss for me.\n\nIf this could help me shed the 'Maniac' image that I had been stuck with for so long, then it might actually be beneficial.\n\n\"So you're just going to sit back and reap the benefits?\"\n\n\"Now that you mention it, you're right~\"\n\nGolden Boy nodded in understanding.\n\nHanding the newspaper back to him, I said,\n\n\"This conversation has gone on long enough. Class is about to start.\"\n\n\"Ugh... I really don't want to go...\"\n\n\"Get a grip. Final exams start next week.\"\n\n\"Shit, that's right.\"\n\nWith a groan, Golden Boy trudged off toward the academy building.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I'm coming in.\"\n\nA cheerful voice followed, and the closed door creaked open.\n\nStanding in the doorway was a girl with brown pigtails.\n\nHer eyes met mine, and a soft smile graced her lips.\n\n\"You must be tired. Have some fruit while you work.\"\n\nWith those words, Rachel set the plate she was holding down in front of me.\n\nThe plate was neatly arranged with various fruits known for their revitalizing properties, such as strawberries and lemons.\n\n\"Ray...\"\n\nI gazed at her with gratitude, touched by her thoughtfulness.\n\nAs expected, Rachel was the one who cared for me the most.\n\n\"Hehe! You look like you really appreciate it!\"\n\n\"Thanks... I'll enjoy it.\"\n\nAfter expressing my sincere gratitude to Rachel, I picked up a slice of lemon from the plate and popped it into my mouth.\n\nThe moment my teeth sank into it, the plump flesh burst with a tangy explosion.\n\nSimultaneously, the sour juice from the crushed pieces assaulted my tongue.\n\n\"Ugh... That woke me right up.\"\n\n\"Right? I told you sour is the best cure for drowsiness!\"\n\nRachel flashed a refreshing smile as bright as the lemon itself.\n\nFor a moment, I was mesmerized by her radiant smile, then quickly snapped out of it and turned my head away.\n\nFor some reason, I felt my face flushing.\n\nMaybe I had the heater on too high.\n\n\"Thanks for this, but... why are you still awake?

You'll be exhausted if you don't get some rest.\"\n\nAs I waved my hand dismissively, Rachel seemed to fall into thought.\n\n\"Then when are you planning on going to sleep, Young Master?\"\n\n\"Me...? Well, I can't seem to fall asleep, so I thought I'd get some studying done...\"\n\n\"......Are you still having trouble sleeping at night?\"\n\nRachel's expression darkened at my words.\n\nI forced an awkward smile and fiddled with my sleeve.\n\n\"Well... Insomnia doesn't just disappear overnight...\"\n\n\"What about the sleeping pills I gave you last time...?\"\n\n\"They don't seem to be very effective.\"\n\nOf course, the reason the sleeping pills had no effect was because of my 'Iron Will' trait.\n\nRachel bit her lip, her expression a mixture of concern and frustration.\n\nShe seemed genuinely worried about my inability to sleep.\n\n\"That's strange... I'm sure you were sleeping soundly that day.\"\n\n\"That day...?\"\n\n\"You know, the day you were discharged from the infirmary.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nShe was talking about that day.\n\nThe day after the banquet hall attack.\n\nThe day I cried myself to sleep in Rachel's arms.\n\n\"Why are we suddenly bringing that up...?\"\n\nI averted my gaze, feeling a wave of embarrassment wash over me as I recalled that mortifying memory.\n\nSeemingly oblivious to my reaction, Rachel remained deep in thought, her chin resting on her hand.\n\nSilence fell between us, punctuated only by Rachel's soft murmurs as she pondered the situation.\n\nThen, she suddenly spoke up.\n\n\"Say, Young Master...

You promised to grant my wish if I managed to survive for three years in this world.\"\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[To be precise, it was to show you the 'true ending' of this world.]\n\n[In return, I promised to give you a happy life.]\n\n[Therefore, wouldn't it be a good thing if time felt like it was passing quickly? It means you're steadily moving towards your goal.]\n\n\"Yeah... You're right.\"\n\nI readily agreed with the status window's point.\n\nHowever, a lingering sense of unease remained in my heart.\n\nThe true ending, and a happy life.\n\nPerhaps I had been overlooking a crucial fact all along.\n\nThis world was nothing more than a stopover for me.\n\nA place I would eventually have to leave once all the conditions of the contract were fulfilled.\n\n‘Am I... becoming too attached to this world?’\n\nThe thought filled me with a strange sense of melancholy.\n\nMy already turbulent emotions seemed to churn even more restlessly.\n\nSuppressing my conflicted feelings, I quietly asked the status window,\n\n\"What happens to me... when the contract ends?\"\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[Unable to comprehend the question.]\n\n\"Will I leave this world... when everything is over?\"\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[It is difficult to give you a definite answer.]\n\n[While I did promise you a happy life, even I do not know what form it will take.]\n\n[You may continue to reside in this world, or you may be transported to another.]\n\n\"So, you're saying you don't know either?\"\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[That is correct.]\n\n\"This whole thing seems fishy... Are you scamming me?\"\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[You are free to terminate the contract right now if you do not trust me.]\n\n[I have never once forced you into this agreement.]\n\n\"As if I could back out now.\"\n\nI chuckled dryly and leaned back in my chair.\n\nAs I massaged my forehead, trying to organize my thoughts, the status window, still hovering in mid-air, added a few more words.\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[I am being serious.]\n\n[If fulfilling the terms of our contract becomes too burdensome, you are free to terminate it at any time.]\n\n[Your soul will return to the four seasons if you choose to do so... but there will be no pain.]\n\n[I will ensure that you can close your eyes peacefully.]\n\n\"Haha... So you're saying I can always just run away if things get too tough?\"\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[That is correct.]\n\n\"Well... I'll keep that in mind if things ever get unbearable.\"\n\nI nodded at the status window's words.\n\nBeing able to unilaterally break the contract and escape wasn't a bad deal.\n\nOf course, I hoped it wouldn't come to that...\n\n\"...This is complicated.\"\n\nIt was a night filled with contemplation.\n\nThe fate that awaited me beyond the world's end.\n\nAnd the escape route that the status window had offered.\n\nIn the end, I spent the entire night wide awake, my mind racing with possibilities, until the first rays of dawn pierced through the darkness.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Just a bit tired from not sleeping well last night.\"\n\nI replied with an awkward smile.\n\nLucy narrowed her eyes, peering at me with suspicion.

I messed up so badly...\"\n\n\"Please calm down, Your Highness... It's just one exam...\"\n\nI patted her back reassuringly.\n\nJudging by her distress, it seemed like the exam results weren't looking good.\n\nWell, to be fair, the difficulty of this exam was brutal.\n\nEspecially Professor Sharon's questions, that damn blue-haired woman.\n\nHer questions were on another level entirely.\n\n‘Who in their right mind puts concepts related to the 'Re-Creation' on an Academy exam...?’\n\nThe exam paper was packed with concepts that were more likely to appear in Magus Tower research papers.\n\nMost students probably had mental breakdowns the moment they laid eyes on the questions.\n\nIt was an impossible level of difficulty for the Academy.\n\n\"Professor Sharon... went too far...\"\n\n\"The difficulty of this exam was indeed high. They even included concepts that we haven't learned yet...\"\n\n\"Sob... but I still got two questions wrong...!\"\n\n\"Two questions... you say?\"\n\nOn an exam where the estimated average score was 41 out of 100, that was practically a perfect score.\n\nEven the top students usually missed fifteen to twenty questions.\n\nAnd she only got two wrong...?\n\n\"...Your Highness, I believe that would make you the top of the class.\"\n\n\"Lady Phyler only got one wrong...\"\n\n\"Lady Phyler is quite something.\"\n\nI, on the other hand, had missed nine questions.\n\nIt was a decent score compared to the other students, but it was nothing compared to the true geniuses like Lucy and Margaret.\n\nFeeling a little embarrassed, I tucked my exam paper back into my bag.\n\nAs I was trying to comfort the still-dejected Lucy, I heard familiar voices calling out from behind us.\n\n\"Hey! It's my brother!\"\n\n\"Woohoo! Look who it is, the one and only Maniac!\"\n\nI turned around to see the red-haired angel and the golden-haired delinquent walking towards us.\n\n\"Brother! How did you do on the exam?\"\n\nAriel rushed over and threw her arms around me.\n\nI chuckled and gently stroked her hair.\n\n\"Not bad... how about you?\"\n\n\"I aced it! I might actually be the top of the class this time!!\"\n\n\"Oh...\"\n\nI clapped my hands together and let out an impressed whistle.\n\nIf Ariel got the top spot, wouldn't that mean she'd be stealing the title from Clara Misoph, one of Allen's heroines?\n\n\"Good job, you were pretty bummed about getting second place last midterm.\"\n\n\"Yeah! I studied super hard this time!!\"\n\nI wondered how Clara Misoph would react to losing her top spot...\n\nIt would be quite amusing to see, considering how obsessed she was with her grades in the original story.\n\nI still hadn't forgotten the smug look on her face when she rubbed it in Ariel's face that she had gotten second place last time.\n\nMaybe I should go and witness the drama firsthand later?\n\n\"Ariel... you're first place... sob, and I'm second...\"\n\n\"Y-Your Highness?! Why are you crying?\"\n\n\"I'm second... I'm trash...\"\n\nWhile Lucy and Ariel were having their little moment, the Golden Boy, who had been lurking nearby, sauntered over to us.\n\nHe glanced at the weeping Lucy and asked,\n\n\"What's wrong... Why is Your Highness in tears...?\"\n\n\"She missed first place by one question.\"\n\n\"Oh dear...\"\n\nThe Golden Boy looked at Lucy with feigned sympathy.\n\n\"Cheer up, Your Highness. Second place is still amazing.\"\n\n\"Thank you...\"\n\n\"Second place is still amazing.\"\n\n\"...Why did you say it twice?\"\n\nI had a feeling he was up to something when his expression brightened at the mention of ‘second place.’\n\nAnd there he was, the Golden Boy, teasing the First Princess of the Empire without a care in the world.\n\nHe was literally risking his life for a prank.\n\nThis guy was definitely the biggest troll in the entire Empire.\n\nAs I stared at him with a mixture of amusement and exasperation, his mismatched eyes met mine, a mischievous glint dancing in their depths.\n\n\"Well, well, well, if it isn't the Maniac.

What about you?\"\n\n\"Heh heh!\"\n\nThe Golden Boy let out an obnoxious chuckle and held up three fingers in response to my question.\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nDon't tell me he got third place in the entire year.\n\n\"I got third place in the year!\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"From the bottom!!\"\n\n\"Oh...?\"\n\nI was about to congratulate him on getting third place, but then I processed the rest of his sentence.\n\nThird place in the year... from the bottom.\n\nIn other words...\n\n\"You're saying you're practically at the bottom of the barrel, you absolute degenerate?\"\n\n\"You could say that!\"\n\nThe Golden Boy grinned proudly and gave me a thumbs-up.\n\n...What was wrong with this guy?\n\nHe was definitely not human.\n\nI sighed and rubbed my forehead, and the Golden Boy just laughed.\n\n\"Whatever~ It doesn't really matter, right? I can just make up for it in the ranking battle next week~\"\n\n\"Hmm... make up for it in the ranking battle, huh?\"\n\nThe ranking battle.\n\nIt was an exam that all students in the Academy participated in.\n\nIt was a one-on-one tournament where students fought each other to determine their rank.\n\nWith the Golden Boy's skills, he would definitely get a good ranking unless he got extremely unlucky with the matchups.\n\nThe ranking battle had almost as much impact on grades as the written exams.\n\n\"This guy has a plan, you know..\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\nI replied nonchalantly, but I couldn't help but scoff internally.\n\nDid he think I didn't know about using the ranking battle to compensate for my written exam score?\n\nI had my reasons for not relying on it.\n\n\"...You'll regret that.\"\n\n\"Huh?

      "content": "Preparing for Chaos\n\nThe invasion of Reynolds Academy.\n\nThis event took place in Volume 3 of \"Sorrow-erasing heroes.\"\n\nIt was the episode where the Demon King's army, which had not shown its true colors until then, finally took the stage.\n\nPowerful enemies began to appear before Allen, who had been unrivaled within the Academy.\n\nIn the original story, the attack was brought to an end thanks to Allen's efforts.\n\nHowever, a significant number of students were injured or lost their lives.\n\n\"The Academy invasion, huh...\"\n\nSitting alone on a bench in the training hall, I muttered to myself, resting my chin on my hand.\n\nThe invasion was like a grand finale to the academic year.\n\nIn other words, once we got past this incident, nothing else would happen until the end of winter break.\n\nI absentmindedly fiddled with the wooden sword in my hand.\n\nIt was because the contents of the main quest I had received a few days ago came to mind.\n\nI quietly parted my lips and called out to the status window.\n\n\"Status window.\"\n\n*—Ding!*\n\nThe familiar mechanical sound rang out, and a blue screen materialized in front of me.\n\nI casually manipulated the screen and brought up the information about the main quest.\n\n*—Ding!*\n\n[Main Quest Pending]\n\nTitle: Unbreakable\n\n[Description]\n\nThe Demon King's army is attacking the Academy.\n\nProtect the Academy from the cruel shadows.\n\nEnemy Scale: To be revealed in 5 days, 4 hours, and 27 minutes.\n\n[Penalties Upon Failure]\n\n1. Weakening of Reynolds Academy's Forces\n\n2. 328 Deaths\n\n\"Well... I guess things are going similar to the original story so far.\"\n\nI let out a low whistle as I looked at the text box labeled \"Penalties Upon Failure.\"\n\nIn the original story, the number of casualties from the Academy invasion had reached 300.\n\nIt seemed that this incident would unfold in a similar manner unless I intervened.\n\nIt's a grimdark novel for a reason, I guess.\n\nTo think that they'd kill off this many students in an early-game event.\n\nA fleeting thought crossed my mind, complaining about how excessive it was, but I quickly brushed it aside.\n\n\"Well... it's my job to stop it.\"\n\nThe deaths of countless students.\n\nSuch a tragedy would not come to pass.\n\nBecause I had made up my mind to alter the fate of the Academy.\n\nAfter briefly pondering the penalties with a sigh, I scrolled up the screen to the next section.\n\nThis time, it was a text box labeled \"Rewards Upon Success.\"\n\n*—Ding!*\n\n[Rewards Upon Success]\n\n1. +1500 Favorability with Academy Students\n\n2. 3000 Points\n\n3. Acquire Title: 'Hero of ■■'\n\n4. Acquire Skill: 'Sanctuary'\n\n\"The rewards are insane.\"\n\nAs expected, the quality of the rewards matched the difficulty of the penalties.\n\nA massive amount of favorability, points, a title, and a skill?\n\nIt was like a comprehensive gift set, overflowing with goodies.\n\n\"The skill is pretty good for an early-game quest reward.\"\n\nThe 'Sanctuary' skill offered as a reward upon success was an A-rank buff skill.\n\nIt was a skill that Allen had frequently used even in the latter half of the story.\n\nIt created a domain infused with purifying energy around the caster, healing their allies.  You could think of it as a kind of healing barrier.\n\n\"It's one of the best buff skills out there.\"\n\nIf I could get my hands on this skill, I'd be able to handle future dangers much more smoothly.\n\nOf course, I had to succeed in the quest first...\n\n\"Haa... there's a lot to prepare for...\"\n\nI guess I'll be busy for a while.\n\nI muttered to myself as I stood up from the bench.\n\nThree days until the invasion.\n\nI set out to prevent the impending tragedy.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIf I remembered correctly, two mid-boss enemies would appear in this invasion.\n\nTwin demons with crimson skin.\n\nThe Left Hand, Rakious, and the Right Hand, Tenebrious.\n\nBoth of them held mid-rank positions in the Demon King's army.\n\nAccording to the descriptions, they were supposed to be quite powerful.\n\nI briefly closed my eyes, visualizing the twin demons in my mind.\n\nIn the original story, Allen had dealt with Rakious.\n\nProfessor Aron and the other instructors had subdued Tenebrious.\n\nThere had been casualties during the battle back then, but...\n\n\"This time, it'll be different.\"\n\nUnlike the original story, Korn was present at the Academy.\n\nOriginally, Korn should have been banished from the Empire for failing to prevent the princess's death.\n\nHowever, because I had saved Lucy from the Seekers, she was still able to maintain her position as the headmistress of the Academy.\n\nKorn Ronezia is known as the strongest woman in humanity.\n\nShe would be able to control the situation and prevent any harm from coming to the students, even in the midst of a chaotic battle.\n\n\"The twins shouldn't be a problem.\"\n\nWith Korn on our side, what could a couple of mid-rank demons possibly do?\n\nThey might put up a fight, but it was almost a foregone conclusion that Korn would crush them.\n\n\"In that case, the real problem lies elsewhere.\"\n\nI pushed aside my worries about the twins and shifted my focus to a new concern.\n\nThis event was literally an \"invasion.\"\n\nIt wouldn't just be the twins.  A wave of thousands of monsters would be crashing against the Academy.\n\nIt would be utter chaos.\n\n\"The key is how to stop the monsters...\"\n\nI stroked my chin, lost in thought.\n\nWould it be best for me to step up in this situation?\n\nThe twins would be causing a ruckus at the main gate, while the monsters would be swarming in from the rear gate.\n\nI could leave the main gate to Allen and Korn.\n\nIf I took care of the rear gate, it would be a perfect plan.\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nAs I was lost in thought, tapping my fingers on the desk, I heard a knock on the door.\n\n*—Knock, knock...*\n\n*—Young Master, may I come in?*\n\nIt was Rachel.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

This is what you asked for, Young Master!\"\n\n\"You got it faster than I expected. Thank you.\"\n\nWhat Rachel handed me was a crystal ball the size of my palm.\n\nIt emitted a faint blue light and was commonly known as a \"communication artifact.\"\n\nJudging by the strong flow of mana within it, it seemed to be quite a high-grade item.\n\nIt couldn't have been easy to get your hands on something like this.\n\nAs expected of Rachel, an exceptionally capable maid.\n\n\"You make it sound like my competence is a surprise, Young Master.  You don't have to look at me with such intensity~\"\n\nI gave her a thumbs-up and turned my attention back to the crystal ball.\n\nNow... how did this thing work again?\n\nI vaguely recalled my memories and channeled my mana into the artifact.\n\nSoon, the crystal ball began to connect to somewhere.\n\n\"Young Master...? Who are you suddenly trying to contact...?\"\n\n\"You'll find out when it connects.\"\n\n*—Beep, beep, beep...

Young Master...?}\n\n\"Yes, it's me.\"\n\nA wave of nostalgia washed over me as I heard his voice after such a long time.\n\nHowever, I quickly pushed it aside.\n\nThis was no time to be reminiscing.\n\n\"Old man, it's an emergency.\"\n\n—{An emergency...?}\n\n\"So, could you please connect me to my father right away?\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMy conversation with my father after almost half a year was incredibly awkward.\n\nI couldn't help but fidget with my hands as the awkwardness washed over me.\n\n—{...So, you suddenly called me just to say that?}\n\n—{That you're sending Ariel and Rachel back to the main residence for a week?}\n\n\"Yes, that's right...\"\n\nMy tongue felt heavy.\n\nWas it because of the aversion I felt towards the word \"father\"?\n\nIt was a strangely difficult feeling to deal with.\n\n—{After five months of no contact, no less.}*\n\n\"...\"\n\n—{Well, I won't scold you.

Father.\"\n\nHe had agreed much more easily than I expected.\n\nHe didn't even ask why I was sending them back to the main residence.\n\n‘Come to think of it... before he became a good-for-nothing, Raiden had his father's absolute trust.’\n\nIt seemed that my recent rise in reputation and the rumors circulating outside the Academy had helped to restore some of that lost trust.\n\nI held the now-silent crystal ball in my hand, a strange mix of emotions swirling within me.\n\nHowever, I quickly pulled myself together.\n\nThis was no time to be lost in thought.\n\nRachel and Ariel's safety had been secured, which left Lucy.\n\nIn that case, the next place I needed to contact was...\n\n—{Bella, Head Maid of the Imperial Palace, speaking.}\n\n\"It's been a while, Bella.\"\n\n—{...Young Master Lishite?}\n\n\"I'd love to chat, but I'm short on time...

To think you'd be the one contacting me first.}\n\nAs expected, Milliam answered the call promptly.\n\nI bowed my head towards the majestic voice emanating from the communication artifact.\n\n“Greetings, Your Majesty. I trust you’ve been well.”\n\n—{Of course. Why wouldn't I be?}\n\n“Even with the changing seasons and the arrival of pristine winter, I beg your forgiveness for my incompetence in not paying my respects…”\n\n—{Tsk, tsk… Spare me the formalities and get to the point.}\n\nAs I was launching into my prepared, honeyed introduction, Milliam cut me off with his characteristic chuckle.\n\nI was grateful.\n\nThese formalities always felt awkward.\n\n“Yes, Your Majesty. I’ll get straight to it.”\n\nI composed myself and began to speak.\n\nWell… to be honest, all I had to say was that I wanted the princesses to be able to stay at the Imperial Palace during the ranking competition.\n\n“I have a request, Your Majesty.”\n\n—{…Out of the blue? You want Lucy and Nerine to stay at the palace?}\n\nMilliam let out a questioning hum after hearing my request.\n\nYeah, he probably thinks I’m drunk or something.\n\nIf I were him, I'd probably think a mere young master suddenly calling me directly with such a strange request was crazy.\n\nBut I had no other choice.\n\nThis was the best way to ensure Lucy’s safety.\n\n—{I fail to understand your intentions behind this request.}\n\n“I have no ulterior motives, Your Majesty. I simply wish for Her Highnesses to have a chance to rest after the grueling exam period at the Academy…”\n\n—{As I recall, the ranking competition also factors into academic standing, does it not? Do you take breaks during your exams?}\n\n“…”\n\nSo he wasn’t going to let that slide.\n\nI tried to cherry-pick the easy parts and gloss over the complicated bits, but I got caught red-handed.\n\nI bit my lip and clicked my tongue softly.\n\n‘Well… Milliam also attended the Academy in his younger days. I guess my excuse was too flimsy.’\n\nAs I racked my brain for a way out of this situation, Milliam spoke again.\n\n—{Very well, I understand.}\n\n“Pardon…? Are you saying you’ll grant my request…?”\n\n—{Indeed.}\n\nMilliam agreed casually.\n\n—{I owe you a debt from before. It’s only right that I grant you a request if you have one.}\n\n—{It’s not a difficult request to fulfill either.}\n\n—{Although, I must admit, the intent behind it is rather unclear.}\n\n‘Well, if you were going to agree so easily, you shouldn’t have pointed out the flaws in my excuse.’\n\nHe was keeping me on edge for no reason.\n\nI let out a sigh of relief and wiped my brow.\n\n—{Is something going to happen during the ranking competition?}\n\n—{It’s hard to believe you’d make such a request without any particular reason.}\n\nMilliam inquired in a suggestive tone.\n\nHe may have phrased it as a question, but there was a hint of certainty in his voice.\n\n‘…As expected, this guy is too sharp for his own good.’\n\nI averted my gaze awkwardly and replied.\n\n“I don’t know what you mean, Your Majesty. As I mentioned before, I simply wish for the princesses to have a chance to rest…”\n\n—{Tsk, tsk… Alright, alright. If you say so.}\n\nMilliam cut me off with his characteristic chuckle.\n\nHe laughed for a while before clearing his throat with a cough.\n\n—{Ahem, so is that all? I must be getting back to work.}\n\n—{As you know, this position doesn’t afford me much free time.}\n\n“Yes, Your Majesty. I shall pay my respects again in the spring.”\n\n—{Tsk, tsk… Spring is too far away. Visit when the Academy is on break. Lucy will be delighted.}\n\nWith those words, Milliam ended the call.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“At least… the most pressing issue is out of the way for now.”\n\nAriel and Rachel would be heading back to the main residence by carriage tomorrow.\n\nAnd Lucy… The Imperial Family would be sending someone for her soon.\n\nNow, all that remained was to prepare for the actual invasion.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nWhat do I need to get ready?\n\nI tapped my fingers on the desk, lost in thought.\n\nA rough sketch of Reynolds Academy began to form in my mind.\n\nFirst, there was the main gate, where the twins would be attacking.\n\nAs I had decided earlier, I could leave that to Allen and Korn.\n\nThose two would be more than enough to repel the attack.\n\n“The real problem is the rear gate, isn’t it…?”\n\nIf the invasion were to begin, the rear gate would be the most vulnerable point.\n\nUnlike the main gate, which would be guarded by powerful individuals like Allen and Korn, or the Academy building itself, where the instructors would be stationed…\n\nThe rear gate wouldn’t have any decent manpower.\n\nAt best, there would be a few guards and student disciplinary committee members…\n\nIt couldn’t be helped. The rear gate was located on the outskirts of the Academy grounds, far from the main building.\n\nThe guards would put up a fight, but…\n\nWell, if they could have repelled the invasion with just their strength, the tragedy in the original story wouldn’t have happened.\n\n“This is tricky…”\n\nThe instructors would prioritize the safety of the students.\n\nSo they would most likely be defending the Academy building.\n\nThere wouldn’t be many instructors with enough leeway to spare manpower for the rear gate.\n\nWhich meant… I’d have to rely on the people around me to hold down the fort against the monsters pouring in from the rear gate…\n\nThe problem was, the enemy forces weren’t exactly small in number.\n\n“…I think the novel mentioned at least a few thousand…”\n\nI muttered to myself, rubbing my tired eyes.\n\nI didn’t want to get involved in anything dangerous… but it seemed unavoidable this time.\n\nIf the defense failed, countless students would be injured or killed.\n\nI couldn’t just stand by and watch.\n\nAs I let out a soft sigh, a scene from the original story flashed through my mind.\n\n—I… I couldn’t protect them…\n\n—I’m… I’m supposed to be the hero…\n\n—They all died because of me.\n\n—It’s my fault… If only I had been stronger… this wouldn’t have happened…\n\nAfter the invasion had ended.\n\nThose were Allen’s lines, despairing over the carnage that unfolded before his eyes.\n\nHe had sobbed uncontrollably, mourning the corpses scattered across the ground.\n\n“…I won’t let that future come to pass.”\n\nBack when I was still Naru.\n\n“Sorrow-erasing heroes” was a novel that held a special place in my heart.\n\nIt was a gift from my brother, Chanho.\n\nA dear friend who had kept me company during my lonely childhood.\n\nA story about children struggling to bring light to a world consumed by darkness.\n\nI truly cherished it.\n\nI loved the emotions that resonated with me every time I turned a page.\n\nWhen I joined the protagonists on their adventures, overcame hardships with them, and shared moments of friendship…\n\nI could escape from my loneliness, if only for a moment.\n\nI could find solace in my pain-filled life.\n\nEven if the current, immature Allen had hurt me…\n\nThe affection I held for him from the past wouldn’t disappear.\n\nOf course, I was still upset with him, but I didn’t want him to be unhappy.\n\n“…That’s why… I want to protect them.”\n\nWho would ever want to see a story they cherish end in tragedy?\n\nI was no different.\n\nI wanted to be, even if just a little, a source of strength for their growth.\n\n“Is it selfish of me…?”\n\nEven if it was selfish, I didn’t care.\n\nI had resolved to not stand idly by as tragedy struck, and I would do my best to help.\n\n“…I hope everything goes smoothly.”\n\nI murmured a small wish as I closed my eyes.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": ".\n\n.\n\nA day passed, and morning arrived.\n\nI stood motionless at the carriage station located near the Academy’s main gate.\n\n*Whoooosh…*\n\nThe cold winter wind ruffled my hair.\n\nThe biting chill gnawed at my skin, rousing my weary consciousness.\n\nI blinked a few times, trying to clear my head.\n\nThrough my vision, blurred by the cold, I saw a black carriage adorned with elegant designs.\n\nAs I was momentarily mesmerized by the ornate decorations, a girl with crimson eyes standing in front of the carriage waved at me.\n\n“See you later, brother!”\n\nAriel hopped onto the carriage with a cheerful farewell.\n\nHer vibrant red hair swayed gently as she bounced on the balls of her feet.\n\nAriel’s signature bright demeanor was enough to bring a smile to my face.\n\n“Have a safe trip. Say hello to the old man and Father for me.”\n\n“Okay! I will!!”\n\nAriel nodded enthusiastically at my request.\n\nShe was such a bright child. She probably took after our late mother.\n\nAfter waving her arms energetically, Ariel disappeared into the carriage.\n\nI turned my gaze slightly to the side.\n\nThere stood a brown-haired girl, silently holding a bag.\n\nShe had been maintaining a heavy silence, but as soon as she confirmed that Ariel had boarded, she stepped forward.\n\n“…Then, I’ll be on my way too, Young Master.”\n\nRachel looked at me with a strangely subdued expression.\n\nA hint of sadness, which she couldn’t quite conceal, flickered in her clear eyes.\n\n‘What’s wrong…?’\n\nWhy was she looking at me with such a wistful gaze?\n\nAs I tilted my head in confusion, Rachel forced a bitter smile, covering her mouth with her hand.\n\n“Please don’t… disappear while we’re gone, okay? If you’re planning to leave, at least… say goodbye.”\n\n“Ah.”\n\nI let out a dumbstruck sound, finally understanding.\n\nCome to think of it, I had said something about leaving soon the other day.\n\nAnd I hadn’t had a chance to explain myself yet.\n\nIt seemed like I’d have to have a proper conversation with her after this whole invasion business was over.\n\n“I’m not going anywhere. Just focus on getting home safe.”\n\n“…Promise?”\n\n“Yes, I promise.”\n\nI brushed off her distrustful gaze with a playful grin and linked my pinky with hers.\n\nPerhaps slightly reassured, Rachel’s expression softened as she climbed into the carriage.\n\n“I’ll be back.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\n“Brother! See you later!”\n\n“Yeah, yeah.”\n\nI waved at the departing carriage for a while.\n\nThe carriage gradually disappeared from sight, swallowed by the swaying scenery and the passing wind.\n\n“…”\n\nWhy did…\n\nthat departing figure fill me with such a strange ache?\n\nI pushed down the unfamiliar pang in my chest.\n\nMy footsteps turned towards the dormitory, each step heavy with unspoken emotions.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“…I can’t sleep.”\n\nI suddenly sat up in bed.\n\nAs I rubbed my dry eyes, a long yawn escaped my lips.\n\nOutside the window, darkness had already painted the sky.\n\nA quick glance at the clock on my bedside table told me it was 3 AM.\n\nAny other student would be sound asleep by now, prioritizing their physical condition, but I was still wide awake.\n\nWas there ever a day when I could get a decent night’s sleep?\n\nI let out an irritated groan, massaging my throbbing temples.\n\nMy hand moved instinctively, reaching for the bedside table.\n\nMy fingers brushed against a small box tucked away in the corner.\n\nIt was the box containing my Deathweed.\n\nWithout a second thought, I pulled out a green stick, put it in my mouth, and lit it.\n\n—Click, hiss…\n\n“Haa…”\n\nGray smoke billowed out with each exhale.\n\nThe faint scent of herbs, wafting into my nostrils, calmed my restless mind.\n\nI took a few deep breaths, trying to gather my exhausted body and mind.\n\nMy eyes wandered aimlessly, scanning the silent room.\n\nThe empty dormitory felt not just lonely, but eerily empty.\n\nNormally, I’d be able to hear Rachel’s soft breaths from beyond the open door…\n\nBut tonight, even that small sound was absent.\n\n“…It’s a little… lonely.”\n\nA wave of melancholy washed over me, and I hugged my pillow tightly.\n\nAs I buried my face in the soft pillow, a familiar scent tickled my nose.\n\nIt was a sweet, comforting scent, like peaches.\n\n‘What is this…? Why does my pillow smell like…?’\n\nI frowned, puzzled by the unfamiliar yet oddly familiar scent.\n\nWith a sense of unease, I examined the pillow and spotted a small embroidery on the corner: “Ray.”\n\n“…”\n\nMy mind went blank.\n\nWhy was Rachel’s pillow in my room…?\n\nDid I accidentally grab it while I was doing laundry the other day?\n\nAs confusion clouded my thoughts, the realization of what I had just been doing struck me.\n\nI had been hugging Rachel’s pillow… and burying my face in it…?\n\n“…!”\n\nThe moment that thought crossed my mind, I flung the pillow away from me.\n\nMy face, cold from the winter air, instantly flushed hot.\n\nMy heart pounded erratically against my chest.\n\nI covered my face with my hands, overwhelmed by a wave of shame.\n\n“What have I done…”\n\nDamn it, why did Rachel have to make such an uncharacteristic mistake?\n\nI tried to shift the blame onto the absent Rachel, but the embarrassment wouldn't fade.\n\nI let out a sigh, my thoughts drowning in the sound of my own frantic heartbeat.\n\n“Damn it…”\n\nThis was turning out to be a very difficult night for sleeping, in more ways than one.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

What are they talking about?’\n\n—We’re not different beings. That’s what we told you.\n\n—You must not forget this.\n\nAs they spoke, fragments of a dream I’d had before flashed through my mind.\n\n‘Right, I had a conversation with them in this exact setting before.’\n\nI gathered my scattered thoughts and approached the two.\n\nQuestions swirled within me.\n\n‘What do they mean we’re not different beings? What is this bizarre phenomenon that keeps appearing before me?’\n\nUnable to speak underwater, I desperately mouthed my questions, my lips forming silent words.\n\nBubble, bubble… air bubbles escaped from my open mouth.\n\n—It seems you still haven’t accepted anything…\n\n—It’s understandable. That person wouldn’t have explained anything to ‘me.’\n\n—He’s always been a strange one.\n\n—I think so too.\n\nThe two boys continued their conversation amongst themselves, seemingly oblivious to my struggles beneath the water.\n\nFor some reason, I felt an overwhelming urge to hear what they were saying.\n\n‘Wait, what are you talking about…! Tell me too…!’\n\nI cried out silently in my heart.\n\nAs if sensing my desperation, Naru and Raiden exchanged troubled glances.\n\nThey remained silent for a moment, then whispered into my ear.\n\n—We can’t tell you… No, we can’t tell ‘me’ anything yet.\n\n—Right now, we’re separated by a wall.\n\n‘Separated by a wall…? What’s that supposed to mean?’\n\n—We wish we could explain everything…\n\n—I’m sorry, but this is our limit for now.\n\nThe illusion that had taken Raiden’s form mumbled softly.\n\nThen, the boy who had assumed Naru’s appearance spoke.\n\n—This is as far as we can interfere.\n\n—Anything more is impossible… unless the wall disappears.\n\nThe two of them gazed at me, their eyes filled with a deep, lingering sorrow.\n\nA strange sense of longing emanated from their depths.\n\n—If you truly wish to know everything… then break down the wall.\n\n—We will find you again.\n\n‘Wait…! You’re just going to disappear like that?’\n\n‘You haven’t even answered my questions. At least tell me what this ‘wall’ is…’\n\n—If you don’t know, you must learn.\n\n—That is how you will reach the new truth and the old.\n\nWith those final words, Raiden and Kim Naru vanished.\n\nPanicked, I looked around frantically, but they were nowhere to be found.\n\nIt was as if they had never existed in the first place.\n\nMy vision began to blur.\n\nAs my consciousness slowly resurfaced, a faint whisper brushed against my ears.\n\n—Don’t forget this time.\n\n—That we are not so different…\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“…Ah.”\n\nWhen I woke up.\n\nI found myself sprawled on the bed in an awkward position.\n\nThe blanket was a tangled mess, a testament to my restless sleep.\n\nI sat up, rubbing my throbbing forehead.\n\nMy mind felt hazy, still struggling to shake off the remnants of sleep.\n\nThe events of the dream lingered, fragmented, and jumbled.\n\n“What kind of a crazy dream was that…?”\n\nNot only was I breathing perfectly fine underwater, but I was also having a conversation with two boys who looked exactly like Raiden and me.\n\nI let out a groan and rubbed my face in exasperation.\n\n“Damn… I must be really exhausted.”\n\nIt wasn’t a nightmare, so I supposed it wasn’t that bad.\n\nBut it still wasn’t a particularly pleasant dream.\n\nI pushed the lingering images from my mind and got out of bed.\n\n‘I can’t afford to be dwelling on such trivial matters.’\n\nToday was the first day of the ranking competition.\n\nAnd it was only two days until the Academy invasion.\n\nI had a packed schedule ahead of me, with no time to waste on deciphering strange dreams.\n\nAfter washing up and changing, I left the dorm and headed towards the nearby carriage station.\n\nI had a lot to take care of.\n\nBut my top priority was to participate in the ranking competition.\n\nEven if there was a high chance of the exams being canceled, I couldn’t just ignore the tournament bracket that had already been set.\n\n—Whoooosh…\n\nA gust of wind brushed past my cheeks.\n\nThe winter air had a way of jolting you awake, even on the sleepiest of mornings.\n\nWith each tired yawn, a long, white puff of breath escaped my lips.\n\nAs I rubbed my dry eyes, a faint scent of peaches drifted into my nostrils.\n\n“…...”\n\n‘Don’t tell me… that’s from Rachel’s pillow.’\n\nThe sweet fragrance clinging to my clothes for some reason made me feel strangely flustered.\n\n“What am I doing… I’m not some lovesick teenager…”\n\nI fanned my flushed cheeks, trying to cool down.\n\nI had arrived at my destination before I knew it.\n\nI boarded a passing carriage and set off for the training grounds, where the ranking competition would be held.\n\nThe scenery outside the window flew by in a blur.\n\nI leaned back in my seat, my thoughts drifting towards the tournament that was only a few hours away.\n\n‘Come to think of it… my first opponent is Margaret, isn’t it?’\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Let’s go!”\n\n“Hold on! We need to get popcorn!”\n\nPerhaps it was because the ranking competition had begun.\n\nThe atmosphere within the Academy was more heated than ever.\n\n“Who was it again, in the first match?”\n\n“Kelvin, the Reverse Grip Greatswordsman, and Karl, the Hammer! It’s going to be an amazing match!”\n\n“Hmm… I’m more looking forward to the third match, though.”\n\nIn front of the open training grounds, where the ranking competition would take place…\n\nA large crowd of students had already gathered, creating a lively, bustling scene.\n\nTheir eyes, filled with excitement and anticipation, were glued to the tournament bracket displayed on the bulletin board.\n\nKelvin, the Reverse Grip Greatswordsman, versus Karl, the Hammer.\n\nCurien, the Black Magician, versus Ronne, the Divine Knight.\n\nThere were many matches that piqued the students’ interest.\n\nAnd among them, the one that drew the most attention was…\n\n“Hey, hey, look at this!”\n\n“No way… Is this for real…?”\n\n[Match 4]\n\n[Raiden Lishite vs. Margaret Phyler]\n\nIt was the matchup between Raiden and Margaret.\n\nThe students’ eyes sparkled with interest as they stared at the two names listed side by side.\n\n“The top student of the Magic Department, Lady Phyler’s match…! I have to see this!”\n\n“I heard that Young Master Lishite has been making quite a name for himself with his recent exploits… This is going to be interesting.”\n\n“They’re both incredibly skilled.”\n\n“This match is going to be a sight to behold.”\n\nMargaret, who reigned supreme as the top student of the Magic Department.\n\nAnd Raiden, who had earned the title of “Hero of the Academy” for his recent accomplishments.\n\nIt was a confrontation that was bound to be captivating.\n\nAnd there was one more thing.\n\nAside from their exceptional skills, there was another element that drew the students’ attention…\n\n“Wow… Talk about a brutal bracket.”\n\n“Why would they pit ex-fiancés against each other…?”\n\n“I heard it hasn’t even been two years since they broke off their engagement.”\n\n“Well, it’ll be entertaining, but… are you sure this is okay…?”\n\nIt was the relationship between the boy and the girl.\n\nTwo of the most skilled individuals in the Academy, bound by a complicated past.\n\nWith such captivating factors in play, it was no surprise that the match between Margaret and Raiden was generating a lot of buzz.\n\n“I can’t wait for it to start!”\n\n“Who are you rooting for?”\n\n“Lady Phyler, of course! What about you?”\n\n“Young Master Lishite. We’re both in the Swordsmanship Department.”\n\nAs their turn approached, the training grounds grew increasingly crowded.\n\nThe spectator seats, with a capacity of nearly 5,000, were packed with excited students and faculty members.\n\nAnd amidst the fervent crowd stood a silver-haired girl and a black-haired boy, their expressions a mixture of apprehension and anticipation.\n\n***\n\n—Rooooar!!!\n\nAs I stepped into the arena, a deafening roar washed over me.\n\nIt was the sound of the crowd, packed tightly into the spectator seats.\n\nI frowned, my ears ringing slightly as I adjusted the practice steel sword in my hand.\n\n‘Seriously, what’s with all the commotion?’\n\n‘What’s there to be so excited about?’\n\n‘And why are there so many people here just to watch…?’\n\nI broke out in a cold sweat as I surveyed the nearly full spectator stands.\n\nEveryone was clutching bags of popcorn, cheering their hearts out.\n\n“…”\n\n‘Sometimes, I just don’t understand the sensibilities of this world.’\n\n‘It’s just a practical exam, even if it is part of a festival. Why are they so worked up over it?’\n\nI let out a small sigh and glanced up, my eyes meeting those of the silver-haired girl standing opposite me.\n\n“…”\n\n“…”\n\nHer crimson eyes burned with an ethereal glow.\n\nOur gazes locked for a brief moment, then the announcer’s booming voice echoed through the arena.\n\n《Alright, everyone! The time you’ve all been waiting for is finally here!》\n\n《Let’s get right into it! We’ll now begin the fourth match of the day, a clash of titans!》\n\n—’Rooooar!!!’\n\n‘…Talk about a dramatic entrance.’\n\n‘Couldn’t he just tone it down a notch?’\n\nI let out another, heavier sigh and adjusted my grip on my sword.\n\nAcross from me, Margaret mirrored my movements, gathering mana at her fingertips.\n\n“I won’t go easy on you.”\n\n《Competitors, ready yourselves!》\n\nHer words reached me as I assumed my stance.\n\nNot to be outdone, I replied curtly.\n\n“As you wish.”\n\n《Begin!!!》\n\nThe exam began with the announcer’s thunderous signal.\n\nMargaret, her mana now fully charged, immediately locked onto me and unleashed her magic.\n\n“Wind Cutter ×2!!”\n\nA swift incantation left her lips, and two blades of wind came hurtling towards me.\n\nI calmly raised my sword, deflecting the incoming attack.\n\n‘She’s aiming for my head…’\n\nI gauged the trajectory of her magic and pushed off the ground.\n\nAs expected of a spell meant for probing, it wasn’t particularly powerful.\n\nIn this case, it would be better to counterattack than to evade.\n\nI tightened my grip on the hilt of my sword.\n\nThen, I poured all my strength into a diagonal slash.\n\n—Clang!!\n\nThe sound of metal clashing against magic reverberated through the air.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Screech…!!\n\nThe magic, aimed squarely at my shoulder, collided with steel, erupting in a cacophony of sound.\n\nIt writhed and bucked, desperate to pierce my defenses, but slid harmlessly off my blade.\n\nThe chains, their trajectory broken, flew off course, embedding themselves in the nearby wall.\n\nI couldn’t help but feel a twinge of disappointment as I watched the harmless mana constructs fall away.\n\n《What a clean defense from Young Master Lishite!

Ah, you’re right.”\n\nI brought my hand up to my cheek, my fingers coming away stained with blood. It stung a little. A stray shard of mana must have grazed me during the dispel.\n\n“Why did you save me…? You could’ve been caught in the explosion…”\n\nShe murmured, her voice filled with concern.\n\nI shrugged nonchalantly.\n\n“I couldn’t just stand by and watch as you put yourself in harm’s way, could I?”\n\n“......”\n\nMargaret was speechless, her red lips parting and closing soundlessly.\n\nMeanwhile, the announcer's excited voice filled the arena.\n\n《What a heroic rescue by Young Master Lishite! He saved Lady Phyler from certain disaster!》\n\n《He completely neutralized a potentially catastrophic situation!!》\n\n—Woohoo!!\n\nA wave of cheers and applause erupted from the audience.\n\nThe announcer's next words, however, were spoken in a teasing tone that sent a shiver down my spine.\n\n《My, my, don’t they look cozy together~?》\n\n“…?”\n\n“…Ah.”\n\nWe both blinked, suddenly aware of our compromising position. I was still holding Margaret close, her body pressed against mine.\n\n“….!”\n\nMargaret’s eyes widened in realization, and she scrambled out of my arms, her face flushing crimson.\n\nShe glanced around the arena, avoiding my gaze as the announcer continued his commentary.\n\n《Well, then! I think we have a clear winner!》\n\n《The victor of the fourth match is… Raiden Lishite!》\n\nA chorus of cheers and whistles filled the arena. The audience was clearly impressed by the intensity of our match and its dramatic conclusion.\n\n—That was incredible! I learned so much just from watching!\n\n—That rescue was amazing!\n\n—What was that last technique? Mana Dispel? That’s a rare one!\n\nI shifted uncomfortably under the weight of their attention, my gaze darting around the arena.\n\nMy eyes fell on Margaret, who was making her way towards the exit, her steps slow and uncertain.\n\nI watched her go, a strange ache in my chest. Her usually confident stride was gone, replaced by a fragility that tugged at my heartstrings.\n\n“....”\n\nA confusing mix of emotions swirled within me.\n\nI kept my eyes on her retreating figure until her silver hair disappeared from view.\n\nAnd with that, the fourth match came to an end.\n\n***\n\nMargaret stumbled out of the arena, her legs feeling like lead.\n\nShe didn’t know where she was going. She just let her feet carry her, her mind a chaotic mess of emotions.\n\n—Are you alright?\n\nHis words echoed in her ears, his low, gentle voice replaying over and over in her mind.\n\nShe covered her ears with her hands, desperate to shut out the sound of his voice.\n\n—I’m merely concerned for your well-being…\n\nShut up… she thought bitterly. Don’t say things you don’t mean.\n\nHer chest ached, and a lump formed in her throat, threatening to choke her.\n\nShe felt a wave of nausea wash over her, her vision blurring at the edges.\n\nBut what bothered her most of all was…\n\n—Thump… Thump…\n\n…the frantic beating of her own heart.\n\nShe pressed her hand against her chest, trying in vain to calm its frantic rhythm.\n\nAgain…\n\nOnce again, Raiden had saved her.\n\nHer own stubborn pride, her desperate need to defeat him, had backfired spectacularly.\n\nI should’ve just… surrendered… she thought miserably.\n\nA weary sigh escaped her lips.\n\nShe closed her eyes, her head pounding.\n\n“Get a hold of yourself, Margaret”\n\nShe muttered to herself.\n\nWhat had she been thinking? She knew she couldn’t beat him. And yet, she had let her pride cloud her judgment.\n\nBeing around Raiden always made her lose control.\n\nIs it because… I hate him so much…? she wondered.\n\nThe truth was, Margaret was still young.\n\nToo young to understand the complexities of her own emotions.\n\nThe overwhelming feelings that consumed her whenever she was near Raiden… she had mistaken them for hatred.\n\nShe was oblivious to the possibility that beneath the surface of her anger and resentment, a different kind of emotion was taking root.\n\n“…. ”\n\nShe looked up at the sky, her crimson eyes reflecting the dull gray of the overcast heavens.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "***\n\nThe first day of the ranking tournament came to an end, and soon, the second day arrived.\n\nI had no scheduled matches for the day, so I spent my time reviewing my plans for the upcoming attack.\n\nIt’s tomorrow…\n\nI checked and double-checked my inventory of magic scrolls, the enemy’s predicted attack routes, the hidden escape paths…\n\nIt wasn’t until I was certain that everything was in place that I allowed myself a moment of respite.\n\nYes, this should be enough.\n\nWith my preparations complete, I was confident that we could hold the back gate.\n\nAs for the rest… I’ll leave it to the protagonist and his party.\n\nSpeaking of the protagonist… I should probably check on Allen.\n\nWe hadn’t spoken since our little disagreement. I was a little curious to see how he was holding up.\n\nNow that I think about it, this is around the time Allen’s match should be starting.\n\nI made my way to the public training grounds.\n\nAs I approached, I noticed a large screen broadcasting Allen’s match to the gathered crowd.\n\n“Burn of Star.”\n\n—FWOOSH!!\n\nAllen moved with a speed and precision that belied his age, his every attack a dazzling display of fire magic. The crowd roared their approval as he effortlessly overwhelmed his opponent.\n\n《What an incredible display of skill from Allen! He’s defeated Leol, one of the tournament favorites!》\n\n—Yeah!!\n\nAs Allen stepped off the stage, he flashed a bright smile at the cheering crowd and waved.\n\n…Well, I guess I don’t need to worry about him.\n\nIf he kept this up, he’d have no problem holding his own tomorrow.\n\nI turned and left the training grounds, satisfied.\n\nAs I made my way through the bustling Academy grounds, a sudden gust of wind ruffled my hair.\n\nI brushed my bangs aside and muttered,\n\n“Everything’s going according to plan.”\n\nI spoke the words aloud as if to convince myself. I pushed down the tendrils of anxiety that threatened to consume me.\n\nEverything will go according to plan.\n\nWe’ll protect the Academy. No one will get hurt.\n\nIt has to go according to plan…\n\nIt has to…\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, in a dark and secluded chamber, a sinister plot was unfolding.\n\n“Everything is in place.”\n\nTwo figures, identical twins with glowing red eyes and sharp horns protruding from their foreheads, knelt before a crude wooden throne.\n\nSeated upon the throne was an elderly man with long, white hair and a chilling aura.\n\nThis was Pyren, one of the Four Demon Generals, and the one responsible for the death of Professor Lucas Crayden during the attack on the field trip.\n\nPyren closed the book he had been reading and looked down at the twins. A cruel smile spread across his wrinkled face.\n\n“Heh… It’s finally happening.”\n\n“Indeed, Master,”\n\nSaid one of the twins, Rakious, his voice laced with anticipation.\n\n“This attack… It will be the perfect declaration of war against the new hero.”\n\n“Are you certain of this?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\nHe went on to describe the forces they had amassed for the attack—a veritable army of demons, more than enough to raze the Academy to the ground.\n\nBut despite the twin’s confidence, a flicker of doubt crossed Pyren’s face.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\n“Is something the matter, Master?”\n\nPyren stroked his beard thoughtfully.\n\n“I’m… concerned about the number of troops we have at our disposal.”\n\nHe had fought against the Academy students during the field trip.\n\n“That instructor… He was strong. Stronger than I anticipated.”\n\nThe memory of his battle with Lucas was still fresh in his mind.\n\n“You believe the Academy instructors may be stronger than we anticipated, Master?”\n\n“Precisely.”\n\nThe twins exchanged a worried glance.\n\nPyren studied them for a moment, then said,\n\n“Let's bring Recus with us.”\n\nThe twins’ eyes widened in surprise.\n\n“R-Recus? You mean… the ‘Spear Demon’?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“We need to make sure we’re prepared for anything.”\n\n“But… He’s so… unpredictable…” one of the twins protested.\n\n“His strength is undeniable.”\n\n“And right now, we need all the strength we can get.”\n\nAnd so, the wheels of fate continued to turn.\n\nUnbeknownst to Raiden, who clung to the belief that everything would go according to plan, the world was shifting around him, spiraling toward a destiny he could never have imagined.\n\nA new player had entered the game.\n\nOnly time would tell what role he would play in the unfolding drama.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

It was time for a final check, to ensure everything was in order.\n\n“Show me the details of the available sub-quests,” I requested.\n\n—Ding!\n\n[Available Sub Quests]\n\n1. Hero of Blood\n\n2. Faceless Hero\n\n3. The Madman\n\n4. The Deserter\n\nSeveral new windows popped up before me, each displaying a different sub-quest.\n\nI read through them carefully, organizing my thoughts.\n\nSub quests.\n\nA staple of every RPG, these bonus quests often appeared alongside the main questline. They offered a chance to gain additional rewards without any real penalties.\n\n“A ‘choice-based’ sub quest, huh…”\n\nOf course, not all sub-quests were created equal.\n\nSome, like the randomly generated “common” type, had little to no impact on the main storyline.\n\nThen there were the “choice-based” sub-quests, which, as their name suggested, required the player to make a choice. These choices, in turn, could significantly alter the course of the story.\n\n“This one popped up in the original novel too.”\n\nI tapped my chin thoughtfully, my eyes scanning the details of each sub quest.\n\nThere were four options to choose from.\n\nAs I tapped on each one, a more detailed description appeared.\n\n—Ding!\n\n[1. Hero of Blood]\n\n-Defend the Academy with your life!\n\nCompletion Requirements: Successfully defend the Academy from the demon attack.\n\n[2. Faceless Hero]\n\n-Become a shrouded hero!\n\n-Embrace the shadows and fight alone!\n\nCompletion Requirements: Successfully defend the Academy from the demon attack without revealing your identity to more than 3 people.\n\n[3. The Madman]\n\n-Embrace madness and burn the world!\n\n-Show them your true power!\n\nCompletion Requirements: Side with the Demon King’s army and destroy the Academy.\n\n[4. The Deserter]\n\n-Fearful of the coming attack?\n\n-Abandon everything and flee!\n\nCompletion Requirements: Escape from the Academy before the demon attack begins.\n\n“…Hmm.”\n\nThe descriptions were straightforward enough.\n\nThe first option was the standard “defend the city” trope.\n\nThe second was the mysterious hero route.\n\nThe third… was basically going rogue.\n\nAnd the last one… was running away.\n\n“Well, I can cross the last two off the list right away.”\n\nDestroy the Academy? Abandon everyone and run?\n\nWhat kind of messed-up options were those?\n\nI quickly dismissed them, focusing on the remaining two.\n\n“Well, I already knew which one I was going to choose anyway.”\n\nWithout hesitation, I tapped on the second option.\n\n—Ding!\n\n[Sub Quest: ‘Faceless Hero’ has been activated!]\n\nI needed to keep my identity hidden if I wanted to use Sorrow during the attack.\n\nThis sub quest lined up perfectly with my plans. Besides, the rewards for this one were far better than the others.\n\n—Ding!\n\n[Sub Quest: Faceless Hero]\n\nSecretly protect the Academy from the demon attack!\n\n※Warning※\n\nIf your identity is discovered by more than 3 people, the quest will automatically fail.\n\n{Rewards for the Main Quest will be partially adjusted.}\n\n1. 7000 Points\n\n2. Acquire the Title: ‘Dedication’\n\n3. Acquire the Title: ‘Faceless Hero’\n\n4.

I brushed my bangs aside and started walking.\n\nThe Academy grounds were bustling with activity, the annual ranking tournament drawing students from all grades.\n\n—Dude, did you hear? That guy got knocked out in the first round!\n\n—No way! The brackets were so messed up this year!\n\n—Hey, mister, can I get some popcorn?\n\n—Come on, the next match is about to start!\n\n“…Peaceful, isn’t it?”\n\nI murmured.\n\nThe sounds of everyday life—the chatter, the laughter, the excited shouts—washed over me.\n\nI closed my eyes, savoring the normalcy of it all.\n\nNo one knew…\n\nNo one knew that in just an hour… no, in just thirty minutes… this peaceful scene would transform into a living nightmare.\n\n—Whoooosh…\n\nA cold wind swept through the grounds, tugging at the edges of my uniform jacket.\n\nI pulled it tighter around myself and continued walking, my footsteps echoing softly in the morning air.\n\n[Time Until Quest Start: 2 Minutes 41 Seconds]\n\nI reached my destination—a small park located near the Academy’s back gate.\n\nI found a secluded bench and sat down, waiting for the inevitable.\n\nThe seconds ticked by, each one bringing me closer to the moment of truth.\n\n[Time Until Quest Start: 59 Seconds]\n\nI reached into my bag, my fingers closing around a smooth, white mask.\n\n—Ding!\n\n[The Deceiver’s Mask]\n\nClassification: Mask\n\nRank: Legendary\n\nSpecial Properties: Favor of the Black Clown\n\nEffect: Activates the ‘Perception Down’ magic when worn.\n\nThe Deceiver’s Mask.\n\nA legendary-ranked item I had acquired specifically for this sub-quest.\n\nNot only did it cast a powerful ‘Perception Down’ magic, but it also slightly altered the wearer’s appearance.\n\nWith this mask, I could use Sorrow without fear of being recognized.\n\n—Click…\n\nI lifted the mask and placed it over my face, feeling a cool sensation against my skin.\n\n[Time Until Quest Start: 5 Seconds]\n\nI remembered the scene from the novel, the moment the attack began.\n\nIt started with…\n\n—BOOM!!\n\n…a deafening explosion that shook the very foundations of the Academy.\n\n—Ding!\n\n[Main Quest: ‘Protect the Academy!’ has been activated!]\n\n[Sub Quest: ‘Faceless Hero’ has been activated!]\n\nA series of notifications flashed before my eyes.\n\nI adjusted my mask, making sure it was secure.\n\nMy gaze darted to the back gate, where a horde of grotesque creatures was swarming towards the Academy like a plague of locusts.\n\n—W-What is that?! What was that explosion?\n\n—What are those things outside the gate?!\n\n—They’re breaking through! We need to get out of here!\n\nThe gatekeepers, their faces pale with terror, scrambled back as the horde crashed against the iron bars.\n\n—Clang! Clang! Clang!\n\nThe creatures were a grotesque parody of life—green-skinned, hunched over, their eyes burning with a malevolent light.\n\nGoblins.\n\nEach one carried a crude bomb strapped to its back, the fuses burning brightly.\n\nI knew those bombs. They were filled with a volatile concoction of demonic energy.\n\nBefore the gatekeepers could react, a blinding flash of light filled the air.\n\n—BOOOOM!!\n\nA wave of heat and smoke washed over me as the bombs detonated.\n\nI stood my ground, my eyes fixed on the gate.\n\nThe explosion had blown a gaping hole in the iron bars, and through the smoke and debris, I could see them—a tide of monstrous creatures pouring onto the Academy grounds.\n\nGoblins, orcs, golems, undead…\n\n“…They really went all out, huh?”\n\nI muttered, a grim chuckle escaping my lips.\n\nI took a deep breath and stepped forward, drawing Sorrow from my subspace.\n\nThe creatures turned towards me, their red eyes burning with greed and bloodlust.\n\nI met their gaze, a chill running down my spine.\n\nWe were hopelessly outnumbered, and reinforcements wouldn’t arrive for some time.\n\nIt was a desperate situation, but I refused to give in to despair.\n\n“You have no idea what I’ve done to prepare for this,”\n\nI said, my voice low and dangerous.\n\nI slung my backpack off my shoulder and opened it. Inside were stacks upon stacks of paper—hundreds of them.\n\nMagic scrolls.\n\nI grabbed a handful and hurled them towards the advancing horde.\n\n—Fwp! Fwp! Fwp!\n\nThe scrolls sailed through the air, each one inscribed with a single, powerful rune: ‘Explosion.’\n\nThe creatures hesitated, sensing the danger, but it was too late.\n\nI had already ripped open another scroll—this one inscribed with the rune for ‘Link Explosion.’\n\n“It’s over,”\n\nI said, a hint of amusement in my voice.\n\n—Fzzzt!\n\nA spark ignited on the scroll, and the air crackled with energy.\n\nAt that moment, all the Explosion scrolls I had thrown into the air detonated simultaneously.\n\n—BOOOOOM!!\n\nA blinding white light engulfed the battlefield, the air filled with the deafening roar of countless explosions.\n\nAs I watched the spectacle unfold, a memory from my past life surfaced in my mind.\n\nMy older brother, Chang-ho, had always been a fan of cheesy action movies.\n\n—Hey, Naru, there’s this line from a movie… he had said one day, his eyes gleaming with mischief.\n\n—It’s one of my favorites. It goes…\n\n“Art… is an explosion!”\n\nI said, my voice barely audible above the din.\n\nThe shockwave from the explosions hit me with the force of a freight train, but I stood firm, my gaze fixed on the gate.\n\nThe goblins at the front of the horde had been completely vaporized, their bodies reduced to ash and dust.\n\nI quickly drew more scrolls from my bag, my fingers working with practiced ease.\n\n“Blink x 6.”\n\n—Crackle…!\n\nMy vision blurred, and I reappeared in the heart of the enemy ranks.\n\nI unleashed a torrent of magic and steel—fireballs arced through the air, their heat scorching the ground, while Sorrow sang a deadly song of ice and sorrow, each swing of the blade cleaving through flesh and bone.\n\nRed and blue light danced across the battlefield, painting a scene of utter chaos.\n\nAnd I, standing at the center of it all, was an instrument of destruction.\n\nThis was my place.\n\nI would protect the Academy.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Crackle…!!\n\nA symphony of destruction echoed through the air as a barrage of magic tore through the ranks of the demon horde.\n\nThe ground trembled under a storm of fire and ice, explosions of mana painting the night sky in hues of crimson and azure.\n\n—Thud! Splat!\n\nMangled limbs and chunks of flesh rained down upon the battlefield, a grotesque testament to the carnage unfolding.\n\nThe air reeked of burnt flesh and the metallic tang of blood, the stench of death clinging to the back of my throat.\n\nThe once pristine grounds of the Academy’s back gate were now a hellscape, a gruesome tableau of death and destruction.\n\n“Haa…!”\n\n—Slice!\n\nI pressed forward, my movements a blur as I cut through the enemy ranks. Sorrow sang through the air, its azure blade reaping a grim harvest of demon lives.\n\nI was a lone warrior, facing down an army of darkness.\n\nBut I felt no fear, only a cold determination to see this through.\n\nI moved with a practiced grace, my body a weapon honed by years of relentless training.\n\nEach swing of my blade was a masterpiece of precision and power, severing limbs and crushing bones with ease.\n\n—Crunch!\n\nI stomped down on a stray orc skull, the bone-shattering under my heel.\n\n“Haa… Haa…”\n\nIt had been an hour since the attack began. An hour of relentless fighting, with no end in sight.\n\n…I must have killed at least a thousand of them by now…\n\nBut for every demon I cut down, two more seemed to take its place. The sheer number of enemies was overwhelming, their ranks seemingly endless.\n\nThankfully, the guards had managed to regroup and were now putting up a valiant fight alongside me.\n\nI clicked my tongue in annoyance as I reached into my bag, scattering another handful of scrolls into the air.\n\n[-Muscle Strengthening-]\n\n[-Swift-]\n\nThis time, I opted for enhancement magic.\n\nThe scrolls burst into light, bathing me in a warm glow as runes of power etched themselves onto my skin.\n\n—BOOM!\n\nI launched myself forward with renewed strength, my movements faster than ever before.\n\nMy blade danced through the air, a whirlwind of silver and blue, cutting down any demon foolish enough to stand in my path.\n\n—Shhk! Shhk! Shhk!\n\nBlood splattered across my mask, the warm liquid a stark contrast to the cold porcelain.\n\n…Damn it…\n\nMy movements were starting to slow, my body screaming in protest.\n\nMy lungs burned, my muscles ached, and a sharp pain throbbed in my side.\n\nI spat out a mouthful of blood and gritted my teeth.\n\nI’m running out of time… And scrolls…\n\nMy supply, once seemingly endless, was dwindling at an alarming rate.\n\nAccording to my calculations, I should have been wrapping things up by now. But the reality was far from ideal.\n\n…Not even close.\n\nI laughed humorlessly as I surveyed the battlefield.\n\nThe demon horde stretched out before me, a seemingly endless sea of claws and teeth.\n\nI was exhausted, my body pushed to its limits.\n\nBut I couldn’t give up.\n\nNot now.\n\nI took a deep breath, focusing my mind.\n\nI could feel my grip on Sorrow faltering, my arms heavy with fatigue.\n\nBut I forced myself to press on, pushing past the pain and exhaustion.\n\nI was about to charge back into the fray when a series of familiar voices reached my ears.\n\n“Holly Spear!”\n\n“Wind Cutter x3.”\n\n—BOOOOOM!!\n\nBlasts of holy energy and razor-sharp wind blades tore through the air, obliterating the demons in a shower of gore and viscera.\n\nI turned towards the source of the attacks, my heart soaring with relief.\n\nFamiliar faces were gathered there.\n\nThe students from the Disciplinary Committee, the Saintess, and Allen's heroines, including Margaret.\n\nThey were the reinforcements I had been waiting for.\n\n“You’re alright!”\n\nMargaret called out, her voice laced with relief.\n\n“We felt a surge of demonic energy coming from this direction, we feared the worst!”\n\n“We’re not out of the woods yet!”\n\n“There are too many of them!”\n\n“Form up!”\n\nMargaret commanded.\n\n“We can’t let them break through the gate!”\n\nThe students fanned out, their magic and weapons blazing as they engaged the enemy.\n\nI finally allowed myself to relax, lowering my sword for the first time in what felt like hours.\n\n“Haa… Haa… Fuck…”\n\nI let out a string of curses, my body trembling with exhaustion.\n\nI had been fighting alone for an hour, holding back a horde of demons.\n\nIt was a miracle I was still alive.\n\nBut the battle wasn’t over yet.\n\nNot by a long shot.\n\nWe had reinforcements now, but the demons still outnumbered us by a significant margin.\n\nWe needed to hold out until Korn arrived with the rest of the Academy’s forces.\n\n“Alright, everyone!”\n\nI shouted, raising my voice so that it could be heard over the din of battle.\n\n“We just need to hold them off for another thirty minutes! We can do this!”\n\nI sheathed Sorrow, my gaze sweeping across the battlefield.\n\nThe worst was over, but I couldn’t afford to let my guard down.\n\nNot yet.\n\nThirty minutes.\n\nThat’s how long it would take for Korn to reach us.\n\nThirty minutes to protect these students.\n\nThirty minutes to ensure that no one else died.\n\nI had failed Master during the field trip.\n\nBut I wouldn’t fail them.\n\nI drew Sorrow once more, the blade humming eagerly in my hand.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, in a secluded part of the forest, not far from the Academy’s back gate…\n\nA lone figure stood amidst the skeletal trees, his ragged cloak billowing in the wind.\n\nHe was a man of indeterminate age, his face hidden beneath a hood.\n\nHis clothes were old and worn, stitched together from mismatched scraps of fabric.\n\nA single spear was strapped to his back, its blade glinting menacingly in the moonlight.\n\n—Whoooosh…\n\nThe wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it the scent of blood and death.\n\nThe figure remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the distant battle raging at the Academy’s back gate.\n\nAs his cloak shifted in the wind, a flash of crimson could be seen beneath his hood—a single, malevolent eye, burning with an unholy light.\n\n“…Not bad…”\n\n“Not bad at all.”\n\nHe cracked his knuckles, a cruel smile spreading across his lips.\n\n“This is getting interesting…”\n\nHe reached behind him and unsheathed his spear, the metal screeching as it left its scabbard.\n\n“Looks like I’m needed after all.”\n\nWith a sinister chuckle, he turned and melted into the shadows, his presence as fleeting and ephemeral as the wind itself.\n\nRecus, the Spear Demon.\n\nA harbinger of death, drawn to the scent of blood and carnage.\n\n***\n\nHigh atop the roof of one of the Academy’s auxiliary buildings…\n\nA young man leaned against the railing, his golden hair glinting in the sunlight.\n\nHis skin was tanned a deep bronze, a stark contrast to the pale faces of the other students.

Don’t let them through!\n\n—Behind you! Watch out!\n\nThe sounds of battle echoed up from the courtyard below, a chaotic symphony of screams, shouts, and the clang of steel against steel.\n\nThe young man watched it all with an unreadable expression on his face, his lips curved into a faint smirk.\n\n“There’s nothing quite like a good brawl.”\n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a bag of popcorn, munching on the fluffy kernels as he surveyed the scene below.\n\nThe Academy was under attack from two sides—the main gate, where Korn and Allen were leading the defense, and the back gate, where the masked swordsman and his students were desperately trying to hold off the demon horde.\n\nBoth battles were impressive in their own right, but it was the fight at the back gate that truly captivated the young man’s attention.\n\n“Wow… He’s good”\n\nhe said, nodding his head in approval.\n\nThe masked swordsman was a whirlwind of death and destruction, his movements so fast they were almost a blur.\n\nEvery swing of his sword sent demons flying, their bodies ripped apart by the sheer force of his attacks.\n\n“He fights like a demon himself.”\n\nThe young man chuckled, tossing another handful of popcorn into his mouth.\n\nHis eyes, now glowing with an eerie blue light, seemed to see past the mask, peering into the very soul of the swordsman.\n\n“Interesting…”\n\nThe tide of the battle seemed to be turning in favor of the Academy’s students, but the young man knew better.\n\nHe could sense it—a dark presence lurking in the shadows, its power far greater than anything he had ever encountered before.\n\nA shiver ran down his spine as a wave of cold, malevolent energy washed over him.\n\n“This… This is bad”\n\nHe muttered, his eyes widening in alarm.\n\nHe had never felt anything like it before.\n\nThis was no ordinary demon.\n\nThis was something else entirely.\n\n“Can they handle it?”\n\nHe wondered aloud, his gaze fixed on the masked swordsman.\n\nA slow smile spread across his face, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.\n\nThe Golden Boy, as he was known, thrived on chaos and destruction.\n\nHe had intervened in the last attack, his motives shrouded in mystery, but there was no guarantee he would do so again.\n\nHe was an observer, a spectator to the grand play that was life and death.\n\nThe fate of the Academy, the lives of his fellow students…\n\nNone of it truly mattered to him.\n\n“But…”\n\n“If they make this interesting enough…”\n\nHe stood up, his gaze never leaving the battle below.\n\n“Maybe… Just maybe… I’ll give them a round of applause.”\n\nAnd with that, he settled back against the railing, his eyes gleaming with anticipation as he waited for the show to begin.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

BOOM!!\n\nI hurled another scroll at the ground, unleashing a wave of fire that incinerated a group of goblins foolish enough to stray too close.\n\nI scanned the battlefield, my eyes taking in the chaos.\n\nThere were still a lot of demons, but their numbers were dwindling.\n\nThe students were fighting with a renewed ferocity, their attacks coordinated and deadly. Spells and sword strikes flashed through the air, each one sending another demon to its demise.\n\nThe pace of the battle had slowed somewhat, but that was to be expected.\n\nI had been fighting nonstop for over an hour, and even with the buffs from the scrolls, I was starting to feel the strain.\n\nThose two are incredible…\n\nMy gaze fell upon Margaret and the Saintess, who were fighting back-to-back, their movements a blur of motion.\n\nMargaret’s wind magic was a force of nature, slicing through the demons like a whirlwind.\n\nAnd the Saintess, bathed in holy light, was unleashing devastating attacks that seemed to purify the very air around her.\n\nI can’t slack off now…\n\nI wiped the green blood from my blade and charged back into the fray.\n\nMy muscles ached, and my lungs burned with exertion, but I couldn’t stop.\n\nNot while there were still demons to kill.\n\nIf only I could use Blink…\n\nMy signature magic would make this fight so much easier. But I couldn’t risk revealing my identity.\n\nNot yet. I had to maintain my cover, even if it meant putting myself at a disadvantage.\n\n—Gah…!\n\nI gritted my teeth as a wave of exhaustion washed over me.\n\nI had been pushing myself too hard.\n\nJust as I was about to take a step back and catch my breath,\n\nI noticed something out of the corner of my eye.\n\nOne of the students lay sprawled on the ground, his leg twisted at an unnatural angle.\n\nAnd standing over him, its massive fist raised for the killing blow was a hulking golem.\n\nI didn’t hesitate.\n\nI launched myself forward, my boots pounding against the earth.\n\n—Shing!\n\nThe furious slash pierced the space between the golem's eyes.\n\nI twisted the embedded blade violently, and the magic stone embedded in the golem's head was crushed like tofu.\n\nThump, the lifeless body collapsed to the ground.\n\n\"Haah, haah... Stay sharp!\"\n\nI roughly pulled the stunned student to his feet.\n\nThe guy, who had just escaped death, came to his senses belatedly and nodded frantically.\n\n\"Th-thank you! Professor!!\"\n\nHe seemed to have mistaken me for one of the professors.\n\nI didn’t bother correcting him.\n\nI feel… different.\n\nI flexed my hand, marveling at the raw power that coursed through my veins.\n\nThe status window update…\n\nIt had been a week since the system had enhanced my abilities, but it was only now, in the heat of battle, that I was truly beginning to understand the extent of its effects.\n\nMy average physical stat was now a solid B-, and my mana capacity had more than doubled to a staggering 63.\n\nAnd Blink… I can use it twenty times now…\n\nNo wonder it felt so much easier to fight.\n\nI offered a silent prayer of thanks to the status window as I charged back into battle.\n\n—Shing! Shing! Shing!\n\nSorrow hummed with power, its blade a blur of motion, as I cut through the demon, ranks.\n\nI was unstoppable.\n\nI was a whirlwind of death and destruction.\n\nI was…\n\nWhat is that…?\n\nI paused, my eyes narrowing as I spotted a figure moving towards us from the edge of the forest.\n\nIt was a man, his body swathed in a tattered cloak.\n\nHe moved with an eerie grace, his footsteps silent as he glided through the battlefield, seemingly oblivious to the carnage around him.\n\nHe looked like a beggar, his clothes old and worn, but there was something about him… something unsettling.\n\n“…Huh?”\n\nI drew in a sharp breath, my eyes widening in disbelief.\n\nThere was no mistaking that silhouette.\n\nThat aura of menace…\n\nThat chilling presence…\n\n“No way…”\n\nMy mind reeled as a horrifying realization dawned on me.\n\nThat wasn’t just any demon.\n\nThat was…\n\n“…Recus?”\n\nRecus, the Spear Demon.\n\nA high-ranking officer in the Demon King’s army.\n\nThe final boss of Volume 5 of “Sorrow-erasing Heroes!”\n\nAnd he was walking straight towards us.\n\n***\n\nA title that spoke of power and terror.\n\nIn the world of “Sorrow-erasing Heroes!”, only the strongest demons earned the right to bear such titles.\n\nThe Deceiver of Death, Pyren.\n\nThe Black Liar, Liranto.\n\nThe Blade of Death, Lenon.\n\nEach one a legend in their own right.\n\nEach one a force of nature.\n\nBut of all the demons mentioned in the original story, none had left a more lasting impression on me than Recus.\n\nHe was the first demon to ever defeat Allen.\n\n—Huff… Huff…\n\n—Hmm… You’re the Hero of this generation? How disappointing.\n\nRecus had first appeared in Volume 4, effortlessly defeating a second-year Allen in their first encounter.\n\nThe image of him casually wiping the blood from his spear after the fight… It was a scene I would never forget.\n\n—Give up.\n\n—Your swordsmanship is… unimpressive.\n\nHe had remained a constant threat throughout Volume 5, his power and charisma unmatched.\n\nIt wasn’t until Allen received the full blessing of the Sacred Sword, Dawn, and unlocked his true potential as the Hero, that he was finally able to defeat Recus.\n\nIn other words…\n\n“…Shit.”\n\nWe were screwed.\n\nRecus wasn’t supposed to appear until Volume 5!\n\nWe were still in the middle of Volume 3!\n\nA cold sweat broke out on my skin as fear tightened its grip on my heart.\n\nWhy is he here…?\n\nHe wasn’t supposed to show up for at least another two chapters!\n\nThe timeline… It was all messed up!\n\nNo.\n\nThis wasn’t the time to panic.\n\nI needed a plan.\n\nRecus was a high-ranking demon, one of the Demon King’s most trusted lieutenants.\n\nEven Allen had struggled to defeat him.\n\nWhat chance did I have?\n\nNone. I have no chance.\n\nThe thought sent a wave of nausea through me.\n\nI had to do something.\n\nAnything.\n\nBut my mind was blank.\n\nI could only stand there, frozen in place, as Recus continued his approach, his every step sending tremors through the earth.\n\nHe moved with an unnatural grace, his spear held loosely in his hand as if it weighed nothing at all.\n\nI need to think…\n\nBut my thoughts were scattered, my mind racing a mile a minute.\n\nI was so focused on Recus  that I didn’t even notice the students who had gathered near the gate, their eyes wide with curiosity as they watched the approaching figure.\n\n“Who’s that?”\n\n“He’s giving off a lot of demonic energy… He must be strong.”\n\n“He looks humanoid… I’ve never seen anything like it before.”\n\n“Who cares? Let’s just kill him!”\n\n“Yeah!”\n\nBefore I could stop them, five of the students charged forward, their weapons raised.\n\n“Wait! Stop!”\n\nI shouted, but it was too late.\n\nRecus had already drawn his spear.\n\n—Shing!\n\nThe air shimmered as the spear flashed through the air, leaving a trail of silver light in its wake.\n\n—Squelch…\n\nThe sound of flesh being torn apart.\n\nFollowed by the sickening thud of bodies hitting the ground.\n\n“…!”\n\nFive heads rolled to a stop at my feet, their eyes staring up at me, their expressions frozen in a mask of eternal surprise.\n\nBlood gushed from the severed necks, staining the earth crimson.\n\nThe world seemed to tilt on its axis.\n\nIt had happened so fast.\n\nSo effortlessly.\n\nA wave of silence descended upon the battlefield, swallowing even the roars of the demons.\n\nNo one dared to speak.\n\nNo one dared to breathe.\n\nMargaret, the Saintess, the students\n\n…We all stood there, frozen in place, as death walked amongst us.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Gather the remaining members of the Imperial Knights and head to the Academy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nAustin received his orders and immediately left the audience chamber to assemble the troops.\n\nLeft alone, Milliam let out a groan, his hand gripping his forehead.\n\nThe corners of his wrinkled eyes twitched slightly.\n\n\"What in the world…\"\n\nHis murmur was a mixture of bewilderment, anxiety, and worry.\n\nFor a moment, his mind threatened to be consumed by chaos, but he fought to remain calm.\n\nHe was the Emperor of the Empire.\n\nHe could not afford to lose his composure, no matter the situation.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Milliam collected his chaotic thoughts.\n\nThe monsters had targeted the Academy.\n\nThis was the second time, following the attack during the field trip.\n\nNot once, but twice.\n\nThis raised a crucial question.\n\n\"Why the Academy…?\"\n\nWhile the first attack could be dismissed as a coincidence, the second one painted a different picture.\n\nSomething was amiss.\n\nMilliam coldly analyzed the situation.\n\n'I hear the monsters formed a legion and stormed the Academy…'\n\nIt was strange.\n\nThere was no way an ecosystem capable of sustaining such a large number of monsters existed near the Academy.\n\nAnd even if there were, the idea of those ferocious creatures cooperating to attack the Academy was…\n\nImpossible.\n\n\"…It simply doesn't make sense.\"\n\nHow could he explain this situation?\n\nMonsters with the intelligence of, at most, parrots were acting as if they had planned this rampage.\n\n\"This can't be a natural occurrence.\"\n\nThere had to be some kind of intervention.\n\nThe monsters were behaving as if they were being controlled.\n\nOf course, such a thing was unheard of.\n\nThere was no record in history of anyone successfully taming monsters.\n\nBut how else could he rationalize their actions?\n\n\"This is… a disaster.\"\n\nMilliam muttered, his voice heavy with despair.\n\nHe felt a weight settle upon him, a feeling of facing an insurmountable problem.\n\nCome to think of it, about 30 years ago…\n\nHe had visited the underground archives of the Holy Land.\n\nHe had snuck a peek at the forbidden 'Book of Prophecy' and a particular sentence flashed through his mind.\n\n《Descendants, darkness will return.》\n\n《But fear not, for when the darkest night falls upon the world…》\n\n\"…The most brilliant light will also appear in the world.\"\n\nMilliam ruminated on the last sentence he remembered.\n\nHe had forgotten about that sentence, so why did it come to mind now?\n\nIt was as if fate itself had brought it back to his attention.\n\nA feeling of frustration gnawed at his thoughts.\n\nIf he could just read the Book of Prophecy again, he might find a clue.\n\nBut with the recent tensions between the Empire and the religious sect, it would not be easy.\n\nMilliam sighed and bit his lip.\n\nAs he continued to ponder, lost in thought with a hand on his forehead, a commotion suddenly erupted outside the audience chamber.\n\n\"Please calm down, Your Highness! Please wait a moment…!\"\n\n\"I can't calm down! How can I stay calm in this situation!?\"\n\nThe doors burst open, accompanied by a furious voice.\n\nA golden-haired girl strode into the audience chamber, paying no heed to decorum.\n\nIt was an act worthy of reprimand, barging into the presence of the Emperor of the Empire, yet Milliam didn't utter a word of rebuke.\n\nHe simply replaced his troubled expression with a small smile.\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"You're here, Lucy.\"\n\n\"Is it true? Is the Academy really under attack?\"\n\nLucy asked urgently.\n\nMilliam stroked his beard with a wry smile.\n\nHis silence was an affirmation.\n\nLucy's face turned pale as a sheet.\n\n\"Oh, no… Raiden is still at the Academy…\"\n\nThe girl's eyes trembled as if they might spill tears at any moment.\n\nHer delicate hands quivered slightly.\n\n\"Don't worry. Many reinforcements have already been dispatched to the Academy. Young Master Lishite will be safe…\"\n\nMilliam suddenly trailed off, struck by a thought.\n\nYoung Master Lishite.\n\nWhy had he forgotten about him?\n\nThe boy had accurately predicted this situation and sent the princesses back to the palace.\n\n\"Hmm…?\"\n\nMilliam tapped his fingers on his throne, sinking deeper into thought.\n\nThe monsters' strange behavior, the attack on the Academy, the Book of Prophecy, and lastly, Young Master Lishite.\n\nThe pieces of the puzzle swirled in his mind, making the situation even more complicated.\n\n\"…This is truly a perplexing situation.\"\n\nAfter a long silence, Milliam shook off his thoughts and regained his composure.\n\nDwelling on it wouldn't bring him any closer to a solution.\n\nRight now, he had to focus on resolving the situation at hand.\n\nHundreds of the Empire's future leaders were in danger.\n\nAmong them was someone who might even become his son-in-law.\n\n\"I pray for your safety, Young Master Lishite…\"\n\nMilliam muttered to himself, his fingers fidgeting restlessly.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

We need to hurry…!”\n\nShe urged the others, her voice laced with anxiety.\n\nThey had left the battlefield to seek reinforcements at the masked man’s behest, but the chaos had delayed them.\n\nAn hour had passed since the monsters first attacked.\n\n-Get out of here, all of you! If you want to live!!\n\n-Move your asses, you bastards! Want to die?!\n\nMargaret bit her lip as those desperate cries echoed in her ears.\n\nIt was her fault.\n\nIf she had been calmer, and more composed, they could have brought reinforcements back in time.\n\nShe had panicked.\n\nAnd now, they were desperate.\n\nBy now, the defensive line might have already crumbled, the back gate turned into a slaughterhouse.\n\n“Don’t be so anxious, Miss Margaret. I am here.”\n\n“Y-Yes… Headmistress.”\n\nKorn offered words of reassurance to the distressed Margaret.\n\nHowever, despite her calm demeanor, fatigue was evident on his face.\n\nIt was to be expected.\n\nJust like the back gate, the main gate had been assaulted by monsters.\n\nKorn had fought fiercely to protect the students, even resorting to unleashing a portion of her sealed power.\n\n“…”\n\nMargaret clenched her fists, her gaze lingering on the beads of sweat trickling down Korn’s cheeks.\n\nShame and frustration welled up inside her.\n\nWhile everyone else had fought valiantly, she had only fled like a coward, returning with reinforcements that were far too late.\n\nWhy wasn’t she strong enough to fight alongside them?\n\nSwallowing her bitterness, Margaret quickened her pace.\n\n“Headmisterss! Lady Phyler! We’re almost there!”\n\nAllen, who had been running behind Korn, called out.\n\nMargaret followed his gaze and saw the state of the back gate.\n\nIt was a scene of utter devastation.\n\nThe ground was scarred with craters from explosions and stained with the green blood of countless monsters. Their corpses littered the battlefield, a grotesque tapestry of death.\n\nThe stench of blood and the acrid smell of burnt flesh filled the air.\n\nThe back gate looked exactly as they had left it.\n\nExcept for one thing…\n\n“…What happened here?”\n\nThe thousands of monsters that had swarmed the back gate were gone, vanished without a trace.\n\nThe masked swordsman who had slaughtered their classmates and the lone figure in the mask were nowhere to be seen.\n\n“Where… Where did they all go…?”\n\nMargaret’s bewildered crimson eyes darted around, searching for any sign of the missing combatants.\n\nBut there was nothing.\n\nThe thousands of monsters had been reduced to dust by Golden Boy’s overwhelming power. And Raiden, unconscious and slung over Golden Boy’s shoulder, was already on his way back to the dormitory.\n\nThe stage was empty, the main actors gone, leaving behind only the lingering scent of blood.\n\nThe latecomers could only stare at the vacant battlefield, their expressions a mixture of confusion and disbelief.\n\n***\n\nHazy consciousness.\n\nGentle waves lapping against my skin.\n\nOpening my eyes, I found myself submerged in a deep, endless ocean.\n\n‘This place again…’\n\nIt was the third time I’d seen this place.\n\nOr was it the fourth?\n\nMaybe the fifth, or even more…\n\nThe space felt strangely familiar, yet different somehow.\n\nWas my vision distorted…?\n\nAs I frowned, trying to pinpoint the strange sensation, I heard the familiar voices.\n\n-Be careful, Raiden.\n\n-Get a grip.\n\nRaiden and Naru’s voices echoed in my ears.\n\nI turned towards the source of the voices, drawn to them like a moth to a flame.\n\nBut there was nothing there. Only shimmering water.\n\nWhat…?\n\nThey usually appeared as well, so why were there only voices this time…?\n\n-Sorry… Your mind is too unstable right now. We can’t show ourselves.\n\n-The wall’s crumbling because of it… You’re in a dangerous state!\n\nTheir words made no sense.\n\nMy mind, is unstable? What did that even mean?\n\nAnd what wall was crumbling…?\n\n‘You told me to break down the wall before. Why is it a problem now…?’\n\nI desperately tried to speak, but no sound came out. Only a stream of bubbles escaped my lips.\n\n-No, Raiden, that’s not what we meant. You were supposed to break it down, but not like this.\n\n-You might see the truth hidden behind that wall, but the process will be excruciating.\n\n-You might… hurt those precious to you again.\n\nTheir voices, heavy with foreboding, pressed down on me.\n\nI frowned.\n\nHurt them? Those precious to me?\n\nWhat were they talking about?\n\n‘What am I supposed to do…? Tell me what to do.’\n\n-Focus, Raiden. Clench your teeth.\n\n-Don't let that wall crumble.\n\nWhat wall?\n\nHow could I stop it if I didn’t even know what it was?\n\nAs I stared blankly ahead, my sinking consciousness began to rise.\n\n‘Wait, wait…! You’re sending me back already? I still don’t understand anything…!’\n\n-This is our limit. Or rather, your limit.\n\n-Just remember this. If you don't want to hurt the people you care about again…\n\n-Don’t let it crumble.\n\nTheir words remained cryptic.\n\nAnd this time, I didn’t even have the chance to ask for clarification.\n\nClick.\n\nMy vision went dark.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“Cough…!”\n\nMy eyes fluttered open, a dry cough escaping my lips.\n\nI was lying in my bed, back in my dorm room.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Why am I here…?’\n\nThe last of my hazy memories.\n\nIn it, I was in the middle of the Academy's defense battle.\n\nI had engaged in a bloody battle with the suddenly appearing Recus, and in the final moment…\n\n“….!!”\n\nAs my thoughts reached that point, my hazy consciousness snapped into focus.\n\nA chilling sensation running down my spine brought on a dizzying aftereffect.\n\nI got up.\n\nThe sudden movement caused my wounds to scream, but that wasn't important right now.\n\n“The rear gate… how…”\n\nI had lost consciousness right after I cut off Recus's head.\n\nBeyond the rear gate, there were still a horde of monsters that we hadn’t dealt with.\n\nThe defensive line must have been breached.\n\nI was the only one guarding the rear gate.\n\nBecause I had made all the other students flee so as to not get caught up in the fight with Recus.\n\n“D-Damn it…!”\n\nI threw off the blanket that was covering me and got out of bed.\n\nMy legs, desperately trying to find their footing, wobbled for a bit before collapsing with a loud thud.\n\n*Thud!*\n\n“Kuh… Haah… haah…”\n\nWas it because of my body that was completely wrecked?\n\nMy trembling legs wouldn’t move as I wanted them to.\n\nI tried with all my might to raise my body that had crashed to the floor, but it was a pointless struggle.\n\n“Sh… Shit… Move…!”\n\nTwisting my limbs, I crawled across the floor.\n\nBlood from my unhealed chest wound flowed in a sticky mess, leaving a long, thick trail.\n\nAt the end of that unsightly movement, like a wriggling maggot, I was able to reach the window.\n\nCatching my ragged breath, I gripped the window sill.\n\nAnd then I raised my head and took in the scene that unfolded outside the window.\n\nFirst, I had to assess the current situation.\n\nThe fact that the rear gate’s defenses had been breached meant that the thousands of monsters that were there had poured into the Academy.\n\nIn other words, it would have turned into a bloodbath…\n\n“…Huh?”\n\nJust as I was frowning at such a gruesome thought.\n\nI let out a dumbfounded sound at the unexpected sight that entered my vision.\n\n“It’s fine…?”\n\nThe Academy remained perfectly intact.\n\nThe streets, which I had thought would be stained red with blood, were as clean as usual.\n\nThe buildings, which I had expected to be destroyed, were still standing tall.\n\nThe students, whom I had envisioned as piles of corpses, were busy running around.\n\nAnd among them, I could even spot a few familiar faces.\n\n“Just how…?”\n\nThe defensive line had definitely been breached.\n\nSo how was everyone safe?\n\nBiting my lip at the throbbing headache, I looked up at the air and belatedly called up my status window.\n\n“Status… window…”\n\n*Ding!*\n\nThe mechanical sound came as always.\n\n“M-Main quest… show me the information window.”\n\n*Ding!

Even taking care of the situation report so kindly.”\n\nGolden Boy stretched with a chuckle.\n\nAs he was about to get up from his spot.\n\nA sudden stream of red blood trickled out from the nose of the boy who was humming a relaxed tune.\n\n“Ah, dammit.”\n\nAt the sudden nosebleed, Golden Boy cursed under his breath and brought a hand up.\n\nA bitter smile played around his lips.\n\n“…Did I overdo it?”\n\nWell, it had been a while since I’d used up my lifespan in 100-year increments.\n\nIt would’ve been weirder if there wasn’t any backlash.\n\n“I used to be fine even after using this much… Did I get too lax?”\n\nGolden Boy raised his head.\n\nThe clear winter sky was reflected in his blue eyes.\n\nJust two days ago.\n\nIt had only been two days since the entire Academy was in chaos due to the Demon King’s army’s invasion.\n\nBut the radiant sun shone peacefully, as if denying that such a thing had ever happened.\n\nGolden Boy moved his feet, suppressing a wry smile.\n\n“What a damn fine day it is~!”\n\nCome to think of it, it was a clear day like this when my mom died.\n\nGolden Boy muttered to himself, his words a mystery even to him, and turned around.\n\nOn the ground where the boy had been, only a few drops of bloodstains remained, having already gone cold.\n\n***\n\n“…”\n\nThe letter I found lying on the floor contained a lot of information.\n\nInformation that I desperately needed right now.\n\nThe letter was an important clue to understanding the current situation.\n\nI devoured its contents.\n\nSince most of what it said matched up with the messages from my status window, it didn’t seem like there were any lies mixed in.\n\n‘Just what is this letter…? Who wrote it, and how did they know all this…’\n\nI checked the sender section with a questioning mind, but.\n\nThe only thing written there was the strange phrase, ‘From your awesome helper.’\n\n‘Damn it…’\n\nThere were too many things that didn’t sit right with me.\n\nThe identity of this ‘helper,’ how they managed to single-handedly defeat thousands of monsters.\n\nAnd lastly, the reason why they helped me.\n\nI fell into thought with a groan.\n\nWas it because I was overworking my still-recovering mind? My head throbbed, and my vision spun.\n\nThe thread of thought that I had been barely holding onto snapped in my swaying focus.\n\nAnd in its wake, the pain I had been trying so hard to ignore came rushing back in.\n\n“…Ugh.”\n\nMy entire body felt like it was on fire.\n\nDark red blood was oozing out from the wounds I had sustained from being slashed by the spear.\n\n“Haah… haah…”\n\nMy white shirt was already soaked in blood.\n\nPulling myself together with my crumbling willpower, I got up.\n\n{Oh, and you better treat those wounds quickly, buddy.}\n\n{You might actually die, you know?}\n\nRight, I might actually die at this rate.\n\nClenching my jaw, I recalled the sentence written in the last paragraph.\n\n“Status… window… buy… recovery… potion… from the shop….”\n\n*Ding!*\n\n[%!$Purchase complete#%&*!%^]\n\n[Total Points Spent: 400P]\n\n“Sh… Shit…”\n\nA curse left my lips at the outrageous price of the potion.\n\nThis was why I didn’t normally use potions from the shop…\n\nDespite my inner complaints, I had no choice but to grab the two bottles that materialized out of thin air.\n\nI couldn’t afford to be picky about such things when my life was on the line.\n\nWith a shaky hand, I popped the caps off the bottles.\n\nAnd then I immediately poured their contents onto my wounds.\n\n*Glug, glug, glug…*\n\nThe sound of liquid escaping the bottles rang out, and my vision blurred slightly.\n\nI had to momentarily shudder at the cool sensation provided by the mana’s energy.\n\nAnd then, just as the bottles were about to be emptied.\n\nI suddenly noticed something strange.\n\n“…?”\n\nWhy… weren’t my wounds closing up at all?\n\nAn unknown anxiety licked at my spine.\n\nWith trembling hands, I slowly removed the clothes I was wearing.\n\nThe sound of rustling fabric filled the air as the bloodstained pieces of cloth were torn away.\n\n“Ah.”\n\nThe moment I saw the state of my body.\n\nA dumbfounded sound escaped my lips without me realizing it.\n\nOn my arms and legs, deep cuts remained clearly visible, and on my abdomen, the spot where I had been pierced by the spear.\n\nInside those wounds, something black was writhing.\n\nExuding an ominous aura, it was slowly but surely eating away at my flesh.\n\nI stared blankly at it before muttering under my breath.\n\n“…I’m so fucked.”\n\nI was in a much more serious condition than I had thought.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I will never accept this kind of demand.”\n\nWith that, Lorraine steeled herself and moved her hand.\n\n*Knock, knock…*\n\nThe sound of her knuckles striking the door broke the silence.\n\nFollowing the pathetic sound, Lorraine opened her mouth.\n\n“…Mr. Raiden, it’s me.”\n\nA moment of silence followed her voice, and then the closed door slowly began to open.\n\n*Creak…*\n\nAs the sound of the hinges reached her ears, Lorraine couldn’t help but squeeze her eyes shut.\n\nIt was out of fear for the person who would be revealing himself on the other side of the door.\n\n“S-Saintess…”\n\nA faint voice called out to her from the gap in the door.\n\nLorraine flinched and instinctively blurted out the words she had prepared.\n\n“Mr. Raiden! I cannot accept such an absurd demand! Even if I was rude back then, this is too much! I have someone I love! You think you can threaten me with the Duke's authority? Have you forgotten that I am the Saintess of the Holy Order? If you want to fight with authority…”\n\n“Please… save me…”\n\n“So, I’m telling you! It’s absolutely out of the question… What? What did you say…?”\n\nLorraine, who had been pouring out her words in rapid-fire, stopped at the desperate plea that suddenly reached her ears.\n\n“Save you?

Wake up!”\n\nLorraine, who had been standing outside the door, rushed into the entrance.\n\nHer delicate hands shook my body, which lay sprawled on the floor.\n\nI wanted to answer her call, but all I could manage was a hot breath.\n\n“Ugh… Haah, haah…”\n\n“Goodness… Your body is burning up…”\n\nLorraine touched my forehead and frowned with concern.\n\nShe immediately rolled up her sleeves and began to pour divine power into my blood-soaked abdomen.\n\n-Sizzle…\n\nA searing pain, as if my flesh were being burned, shot through my nerves.\n\nIt was the golden divine power, burning away the demonic energy that had seeped into my flesh.\n\n“Kuh…!”\n\n“Just bear with it a little longer, Raiden…! I’m removing the rotted parts for now. We’ll go to the infirmary for the rest…”\n\nLorraine explained as she rose from her spot.\n\nShe looked around, seemingly searching for magic mail to contact the infirmary.\n\n‘I can’t go to the infirmary… I’ve already exceeded the sub-quest’s limit on people who know my identity…’\n\nI grabbed Lorraine’s sleeve with trembling fingers.\n\n“Raiden…?”\n\n“No… infirmary… is…”\n\n“What are you talking about! Your wounds…!”\n\n“Not… infirmary… my room… inside…”\n\nI forced the words out, pulling her along.\n\nHer pure white clothes were stained with dirt.\n\n“Please… I beg you…”\n\nAs my consciousness faded, I muttered those words.\n\n***\n\n“Please… I beg you…”\n\nWith those words, Raiden lost consciousness.\n\nHis hand, which had been desperately clinging to her sleeve, fell limply to the floor.\n\n“Raiden?! Raiden!”\n\nLorraine called his name in a panic, but there was no response.\n\nThe only sound in the silent hallway was his faint, shallow breathing as if it might cease at any moment.\n\n“W-What should I do…!?”\n\nHer beautiful golden eyes were filled with confusion.\n\nLorraine quickly got to her feet, thinking that she had to contact the infirmary.\n\nBut just as she was about to move.\n\n-No… infirmary… is…\n\n-Not… infirmary… my room… inside…\n\nThe boy’s dying words before he collapsed echoed in her ears.\n\nLorraine hesitated, unable to ignore the desperate plea that lingered in her mind.\n\n“Why… Why would Raiden say that…?”\n\nAmidst the chaos, the girl felt a wave of dizziness wash over her as she pondered the question.\n\nWhy would he refuse to go to the infirmary?\n\n“…Come to think of it, Raiden told me to ‘come alone’ and ‘not tell anyone’ before.”\n\nAs if he didn’t want to be seen by anyone else.\n\nAs if he had something to hide.\n\n“What in the world…”\n\nComplex thoughts swirled within her, mixing with her urgent concern and causing a dull ache in her head.\n\nWith a grimace, Lorraine looked down at Raiden, who lay collapsed on the floor.\n\nHis body was bleeding profusely with black blood, slowly dying.\n\nEven in such a dire situation, the boy’s head was pointing towards his room.\n\nAs if he had to go there, not to the infirmary.\n\n“…Ugh, fine! I won’t take you there! But don’t blame me if something happens!”\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Lorraine finally lifted the collapsed Raiden into her arms and started walking.\n\n*Click, creak…*\n\nThe door creaked ominously behind them.\n\nLorraine stepped into the darkness.\n\nShe gently laid the boy down on the sofa in the middle of the living room.\n\n“Huu… Just lie still for a moment. I’ll see if there’s anything here that can help with the treatment!”\n\nAfter speaking to the unconscious Raiden, Lorraine began to examine the room.\n\nHer golden eyes darted around, quickly taking note of the location of any useful items.\n\n‘There’s a regeneration potion over there, scrolls over there, clean towels in the bathroom…’\n\nJust then, something white caught her eye.\n\n“Wha…?”\n\nLying in the corner, stained with blood.\n\nLorraine stopped in her tracks as she spotted it.\n\n“Why is that… here…?”\n\nIt was a mask.\n\nA plain, white mask, soaked in blood.\n\nAnd it was a very familiar mask.\n\n“That mask… It’s the same one from the invasion…”\n\nBack then, when the monsters had invaded.\n\nThe mysterious man who had single-handedly fought off thousands of monsters and protected the rear gate.\n\nThis mask was identical to the one he had worn.\n\n“Don’t tell me…?”\n\nLorraine muttered to herself in disbelief, her gaze fixated on the mask.\n\nThe blood-stained mask, revealing the identity of the lone hero.\n\n***\n\nAs the Saintess stumbled upon a piece of Raiden’s hidden secret, the Academy was slowly regaining its order.\n\nThe Imperial Knights and priests from the Holy Order, who had rushed in to provide support, as well as the soldiers sent from various noble families, were all working tirelessly.\n\nThanks to their active efforts, the screams and cries gradually subsided, and the Academy was returning to its usual winter silence.\n\nAmong them, there were those who were finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n“Huu… It seems like the situation has been brought under control for now.”\n\n“You did well, Margaret. Your help during this chaotic situation was invaluable.”\n\n“I just did what I had to do, Professor Sharon. You’ve been working hard as well.”\n\nWiping away the beads of sweat that dotted their foreheads, the two exchanged words of gratitude.\n\nSilver and blue hair fluttered in the air as a gentle breeze swept through.\n\n“I have an emergency faculty meeting to attend, so I should get going. Why don’t you get some rest, Margaret?”\n\n“I think I will… I haven’t had a wink of sleep in two days…”\n\nMargaret rubbed her tired eyes and nodded at Sharon’s suggestion.\n\nSharon smiled faintly at the girl’s response and patted her shoulder reassuringly.\n\n“Then, I’ll be on my way.”\n\n“Ah… Yes, please go ahead, Professor.”\n\nWith Sharon gone, Margaret was left alone.\n\nShe stood there for a moment, lost in exhaustion, before biting her lip and pulling herself together.\n\n“I should get back and get some sleep…”\n\nWith a meaningless murmur to herself, she resumed her steps.\n\nHer footsteps echoed hollowly through the long, empty hallway of the Academy’s main building.\n\n-Whooosh…\n\nA cold gust of wind blew in through a broken window.\n\nThe cold air brushed against Margaret’s cheeks, causing a puff of white breath to escape her red lips.\n\n“…Of all the times for it to be this cold, even the weather is against us.”\n\nMargaret grumbled under her breath at the dissipating cloud of air.\n\nThe cruel winter.\n\nEven with its harsh nature, it dared to steal the warmth from those who were already exhausted from this situation. It was a truly hateful season.\n\n“Huu… Thankfully, they said the dormitory building has heating… I should hurry back.”\n\nMargaret walked quietly down the hallway.\n\nAs she turned a corner and was about to step onto the stairs.\n\nSomething on the floor caught her eye.\n\n“What’s that…?”\n\nIt was a slightly crumpled letter, lying on the floor.\n\nOn the surface of the paper, adorned with beautiful golden patterns, faint traces of mana lingered.\n\n“Magic mail…? Did someone drop it?”\n\nMargaret tilted her head curiously and picked it up.\n\nShe dusted off the letter and glanced at the sender and recipient’s names, hoping to find the owner.\n\n“Hmm, the recipient is the Saintess. The sender is…”\n\nAt that moment, as her red eyes scanned the sender’s name.\n\nMargaret gasped.\n\nWritten there was a name she had never expected to see.\n\n《Sender: Raiden Lishite》\n\n“Young Master Lishite…?”\n\nMargaret stared blankly at the name written on the letter.\n\n“Why would he… send a letter to the Saintess…?”\n\nThe question lingered in the air, carried away by the cold winter wind.\n\nMargaret frowned, her breath shallow.\n\nKnowing she shouldn’t, she unfolded the letter to see what it said.\n\nAnd then…\n\n“……!”\n\nMargaret gasped again, dropping the letter in shock.\n\nHer beautiful crimson eyes were filled with a mixture of horror and anger.\n\n***\n\n“Um… Come to think of it, I threw away the letter Raiden sent me in a fit of anger…”\n\nLorraine muttered to herself as she prepared for the treatment, soaking a towel in the water while Raiden lay unconscious on the sofa.\n\n“What should I do…? What if someone sees it…?”\n\nShe groaned, suddenly remembering the letter.\n\nJust as she was about to dwell on the thought, Raiden’s groan brought her back to reality.\n\n“Ugh…! Haah, haah…”\n\n“I need to focus on the task at hand…”\n\nPushing aside her worries about the letter, Lorraine focused her attention on Raiden and began to channel divine power into her fingertips.\n\n“Just bear with it a little longer, Raiden…”\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Get ahold of yourself, Allen!”\n\n“Please try to compose yourself. While I understand your anger, he is the eldest son of the Lishite Dukedom…”\n\nVoices rose from behind, attempting to dissuade him.\n\nBut Allen ignored his friends who were desperately clutching at his sleeves.\n\nInstead, he unleashed a burst of mana, his eyes fixed solely on the tightly shut metal door.\n\n-Fwoosh…!\n\nA small flame erupted from his tightly clenched fist, quickly transforming into a writhing crimson inferno.\n\nIt morphed into the shape of a gauntlet that encased his arm—Allen’s unique magic, ‘Flame Gauntlet.’\n\n“...If you don’t open this door, I will break it down.”\n\nAmidst the flickering remnants of mana, Allen delivered his final warning.\n\nBut as expected, the door remained stubbornly shut.

For now…”\n\nClara and Eivy, Allen’s devoted heroines from the original story, looked between us, their eyes wide with a mixture of fear and concern.\n\n“Ha… Haha…”\n\nTheir gazes, sharp as shards of ice, pierced through me, intensifying the hollow ache in my chest.\n\nA humorless laugh escaped my lips, a poor attempt to mask the despair that threatened to consume me.\n\nThe smile that stretched across my face was a grotesque imitation of the real thing, twisted by exhaustion and the bitter sting of hopelessness.\n\nIt wasn’t a smile at all.\n\nIt was a grimace, a physical manifestation of the turmoil raging within me.\n\n“So, once again… I’m the bad guy?”\n\nMy voice, thick with unshed tears, cracked under the weight of my emotions.\n\n“Young Master, that’s not…”\n\n“Shut up.

How could I possibly calm down when my insides felt like they were being shredded to pieces?\n\nBreathing was an effort, each inhale a shallow gasp that did little to alleviate the suffocating pressure in my chest.\n\nIt was as if I were drowning, the weight of their gazes pulling me under.\n\n“You… You’re all the same.”\n\nI spat, my voice trembling with barely suppressed rage.\n\nMy gaze, cold and unforgiving, swept over the girls standing frozen behind Allen.\n\n“You didn’t stop him… You could have stopped him…”\n\nClara, Eivy, you trusted Allen and believed in him.\n\nSurely, you could have calmed him down, reasoned with him before he broke down the door.\n\nBut you didn’t. And that meant…\n\n“You believed him, didn’t you? You believed that I was hurting Lorraine.”\n\n“...”\n\nMy words, sharp as knives, hung in the air, and met with stunned silence.\n\nThey had no answer, their silence speaking volumes.\n\nI turned my gaze to Lorraine, a humorless laugh escaping my lips.\n\n“Lorraine… You threw my letter away, even after I begged you to read it.”\n\nIf you had just read it…\n\nMaybe none of this would have happened…\n\n“Are you happy now…? This is what you wanted, isn’t it?”\n\n“...”\n\nLorraine, like the others, remained silent, her gaze downcast.\n\nI shifted my focus, my eyes landing on the last person in the room.\n\n“…Princess Phyler.”\n\nThe silver-haired girl stiffened at my words, her vibrant red eyes meeting mine with a flicker of something akin to guilt.\n\nA fresh wave of emotion crashed over me, threatening to break me apart.\n\n“...You’re the worst of them all.”\n\n“R-Raiden…”\n\n“I tried so hard to earn your trust, to show you that I’ve changed, but you… You just kept pushing me away.”\n\n“That’s not… I wasn’t…”\n\nMargaret stammered, her voice barely a whisper.\n\nShe started to speak again, but then stopped, her jaw clenching as if she were biting back the words.\n\nSilence descended upon the room, heavy and suffocating.\n\nI stared at them, at the fear and distrust etched on their faces, and a bitter laugh escaped my lips.\n\nHow pathetic.\n\nHere I was, a broken mess, and all they could do was stare at me with those accusing eyes.\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nI couldn’t even bring myself to wipe away the tears that continued to stream down my face.\n\nI stood there, my legs trembling with exhaustion, a picture of utter defeat.\n\nDeep down, I knew.\n\nI knew that their distrust was justified, that the blame for their fear ultimately lay with the Raiden of the past, the one who had tormented them without mercy.\n\nBut…\n\nWhat was I supposed to do?\n\nI hadn’t done anything wrong.\n\nWas I condemned to suffer for the sins of the body I now inhabited?\n\nI had chosen this path, hadn’t I?\n\nI had agreed to atone for Raiden’s sins, to try and set things right. But it was too much.\n\nIt wasn’t fair.\n\nI was used to being hated, to being the villain of the story.\n\nBut this… This relentless, unwavering distrust was more than I could bear.\n\n“What… What was the point of it all…?”\n\nIf there was anyone to blame, it was Raiden.\n\nBut he was gone, wasn’t he?\n\nDead and buried.\n\nSo who was I supposed to hate?\n\nWho was I supposed to blame for this unending cycle of pain and misery?\n\nI searched for an answer, desperately clinging to any shred of hope that might alleviate the crushing weight in my chest.\n\nBut there was nothing.\n\n“You… You don’t understand.”\n\nMy anger, a wild, untamed beast, lashed out, its claws tearing at anyone within reach.\n\n“You don’t know what I’ve sacrificed, what I’ve endured… You don’t know how hard I’ve tried to atone for his sins…”\n\n…No.\n\nThat wasn’t true, was it?\n\nThey weren’t entirely blameless in this.\n\n“This is bullshit…”\n\nThey could have chosen to believe me.\n\nThey could have looked past their preconceived notions and seen the effort, the genuine desire to make amends.\n\nEven if Raiden was the one who started it all…\n\nThey were the ones who had pushed me to the edge with their endless distrust.\n\n“I didn’t ask for much… I didn’t need your kindness, your gratitude…”\n\nAll I wanted was to not be hated.\n\n…Was that really too much to ask?\n\nMy words, a lonely soliloquy, echoed through the room, each syllable a hammer blow to my already fractured heart.\n\nThe shards of my shattered hope pierced my chest, leaving behind a gaping wound that throbbed with each painful breath.\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nShattered.\n\nScattered.\n\nOnly a burning, all-consuming hatred remained.\n\nMy head throbbed, the intensity of my emotions threatening to split my skull open.\n\nI clutched my forehead, a low groan escaping my lips.\n\n-Ding!\n\nThe familiar chime of the system cut through the haze of my despair.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

His wounds were definitely caused by the monsters.”\n\n“…”\n\nHer words lent credence to Clara's suspicions.\n\nThe children's expressions darkened.\n\nMargaret, who seemed the most disturbed, stammered,\n\n“T-Then… what about what we just saw? Was that also because of his injuries?”\n\n“That seemed more like a mental issue than a physical one… but I'm not well-versed in such matters…”\n\nPerhaps Eivy knows more about the mind.\n\nLorraine added quietly.\n\nAt her words, Eivy, who had been silent until now, stepped forward.\n\n“As a matter of fact, I was just about to speak.”\n\nEivy's expression was grim.\n\nTaking a deep breath, she continued,\n\n“From what I can tell… his mental state is incredibly unstable. He could go into shock and die at any moment.”\n\n“What…?”\n\n“To put it bluntly, his mind is on the verge of collapse… I’ve never seen someone so mentally… broken.”\n\nEivy’s explanation, though delivered calmly, was chilling.\n\nAllen, his face etched with worry, asked,\n\n“T-Then… what do we do?

That way, we can access his mind and I can try to fix what’s broken.”\n\n“Wait, isn’t that dangerous? We’d be sharing his emotions. What if our minds collapse too…?”\n\n“It’s alright.

She said we need to assess the situation…”\n\nMargaret slowly rose to her feet.\n\nShe didn't take Lorraine’s hand.\n\nShe didn’t deserve it.\n\nTo rely on anyone.\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nShe stood, her legs shaky.\n\nHer vision, blurry just moments ago, began to clear.\n\nThe floor, stained crimson.\n\nBandage scraps scattered everywhere.\n\nThe metallic scent of blood heavy in the air.\n\nThe vivid reminders brought a chilling reality crashing down upon her.\n\nMargaret’s eyes welled up.\n\nShe stumbled towards the bedroom, her path littered with the remnants of Raiden's breakdown.\n\nA short while later,\n\nMargaret and the others were gathered in Raiden’s bedroom, where he lay unconscious.\n\n“…Is everyone alright?”\n\nLorraine asked, wiping away the tear stains that streaked her cheeks.\n\nHer voice was strained as she addressed the others.\n\nThe children responded with weak nods.\n\n“That’s… good to hear…”\n\nHer words hung in the air, followed by a heavy silence.\n\n“…”\n\nMargaret was still reeling.\n\nShe sat closest to the bed, her gaze fixed on Raiden.\n\nHer eyes, filled with sorrow, fear, and guilt, never left him.\n\nIn the moment their consciousnesses had connected,\n\nMargaret had glimpsed Raiden’s memories.\n\nThe string of tragedies he had kept hidden.\n\nThe other children had seen it too.\n\nThey all stared at Raiden, their expressions heavy with sorrow.\n\n“…I had no idea.”\n\nAllen was the first to break the silence.\n\n“To think that House Lishite… that he… had been through so much…”\n\nHis voice was low.\n\nA shadow had fallen over his usually bright, golden eyes.\n\n“And I… I pushed him… again and again…”\n\nHe remembered the cruel words he had spoken to a weary Raiden after the attack during the field trip.\n\n-Professor Lucas, the Head Professor who died in the attack during the field trip… was it you?\n\n-I’m asking if you killed him.\n\nAllen clutched his head.\n\n“…I’m such an idiot.”\n\nIt wasn’t just memories they had shared.\n\nThey had felt the emotions Raiden had buried deep within himself.\n\nAs Allen drowned in self-reproach,\n\nEivy frowned, her expression unreadable.\n\n“This… This doesn’t make sense. I’ve peered into the minds of countless people, but this… this is a first.”\n\nEivy, the second daughter of House Roben, known for their mastery of mental magic, had just said “a first.”\n\n“I’ve never… encountered someone with such a shattered mind.”\n\nShe muttered, beads of sweat forming on her brow.\n\nThe image of the overwhelming wave of despair she had glimpsed within Raiden’s mind refused to leave her.\n\nHow was he even alive?\n\nAny ordinary person would have been driven mad or taken their own life.\n\nHow could he have endured such agonizing pain and lived each day?\n\nEivy couldn't even begin to comprehend it.\n\n“…Lady Roben.”\n\nMargaret, who had been silent until now, spoke up.\n\n“You said… that we only felt twenty percent of what he feels…”\n\n“Yes, that’s right.”\n\n“Then… Lishite… Raiden… he’s carrying five times the pain… the emotions… that we felt?”\n\n“…Yes, I believe so.”\n\nEivy’s confirmation was blunt.\n\nMargaret felt her breath catch in her throat.\n\nFive times.\n\nFive times…\n\n“How…”\n\nShe muttered, unable to believe it.\n\nHer shoulders trembled.\n\n“I… I could barely handle twenty percent…”\n\nHer cold fingers clutched at her skirt.\n\nThe hallucinations that had assaulted her ears.\n\nThe self-loathing that had threatened to choke her.\n\nThe guilt of surviving at the cost of her mother’s life.\n\nThe compulsion to isolate herself from others.\n\nIt had been unbearable.\n\nAn agonizing, yet poignant loneliness and sorrow.\n\n“Raiden… he’s been feeling that kind of pain… those emotions… all this time…”\n\nThe truth of the boy’s heart, revealed for the first time, pierced her deeply.\n\nMargaret bit her lip, trying to hold back the tears welling up inside.\n\n“I didn’t know… Why… How could I be so…”\n\nHer thoughts were a jumbled mess.\n\nWords tumbled out of her mouth, disconnected and fragmented.\n\nHer vision blurred once more, and tears streamed down her face.\n\n“H-Huh…”\n\nThe children were lost in their thoughts, each grappling with the weight of what they had experienced.\n\nA heavy silence descended upon the room, threatening to consume them.\n\n“D-Don’t… g-go…”\n\n“…Raiden?”\n\n“Young Master…?”\n\nRaiden, who had been unconscious, his breathing shallow, suddenly frowned and began to mumble.\n\n“Please… don’t…”\n\nAs if caught in a nightmare,\n\nHe tossed and turned, his hand reaching out blindly.\n\nThe children tensed, afraid he might try to hurt himself again.\n\nBut his hand didn’t reach for the bandages covering his wounds.\n\nInstead, it found Margaret’s hand, resting on the bed.\n\n“…Please… don’t leave me…”\n\nHe pleaded, his voice thick with tears.\n\nHe pulled her hand towards him, clutching it tightly.\n\nA single tear rolled down his cheek.\n\nDrip, drop.\n\nIt fell onto the bedsheet, leaving a dark mark.\n\n“Mother…”\n\nHis plea, so raw and desperate,\n\nFroze the children in their tracks.\n\n“Please… don’t leave me… alone…”\n\nHis muffled sobs echoed through the room.\n\nFor a long moment, none of them could speak.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, on the road leading to the Academy,\n\nA carriage sped along at a breakneck pace.\n\n-Clatter, clatter…!\n\nThe carriage rattled violently, the sound of hooves pounding against the cobblestones.\n\nEvery time the wheels hit a bump,\n\nThe golden crest emblazoned on the side of the carriage jolted precariously.\n\n“Gilbert!

Please calm down...\"\n\n\"Let go of me, Rachel. I can't hold it in anymore.\"\n\nAriel stormed out of the bedroom, her footsteps heavy with purpose.\n\nRachel trailed behind her, her expression etched with worry.\n\nAriel's sharp, crimson eyes, blazing with fury, swept across the children standing in the living room.\n\nA surge of blue mana erupted around her, sending a chill through the air.\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\"Ariel...\"\n\n\"You goddamn bastards.\"\n\nAriel's gaze, cold and unforgiving, settled on Allen.\n\nIt was clear that she had overheard their entire conversation.\n\nHer voice, as cold as the winter wind, dripped with barely suppressed rage.

Today's the day I finally paint the walls with his blood.\"\n\nAriel shrugged off Rachel's restraining hand and pointed the spear at Allen once more.\n\nThis time, the spear was different. Sharp, icy thorns protruded from its edges.\n\n\"W-Wait, Ariel...!\"\n\n\"Lady Lishite!!\"\n\nClara and Eivy, startled by the murderous intent radiating from her, stepped forward to intervene.\n\nAriel turned to face them, her fury only intensifying.\n\n\"Get out of my way.\"\n\n\"B-But Ariel...\"\n\n\"I said move.\"\n\nThe air crackled with tension.\n\nAriel stood her ground, consumed by rage, for what felt like an eternity.\n\n...And all the while, they remained oblivious to the fact that Raiden had regained consciousness.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Latest released chapter by author is chapter 145.Shatter, Scatter, Hate  (12)\n\nLife, I learned, is about overcoming dissonance.\n\nIdeal and reality.\n\nThe two words had different pronunciations and sounds, so their meanings were bound to be different.\n\nA child who feeds on dreams cannot satisfy their hunger.\n\nAn adult who drinks rationality cannot quench their thirst.\n\nThat's why people live their lives measuring the distance between the two.\n\nWhat we desire.\n\nWhat we must give up.\n\nThe time we spend precariously dancing on the boundary between the two.\n\nWe call it life.\n\nIt was the same for me.\n\nI wished for something and gave up something else.\n\nThe slightly tragic part was...\n\nThe dissonance between them was too great.\n\n-Will you really... make it happen...?\n\nMy ideal was happiness.\n\nI wanted to break the chain of sorrow that continued endlessly.\n\nI wanted to escape from the nightmares that killed me every day, and walk towards a bright smile.\n\nBut.\n\n-Why... Why do you hate me so much...?\n\nMy reality was misery.\n\nI had lived a life of sorrow like a shower of arrows, leaving no room on my target for happiness to land.\n\nTo draw the bowstring, I had to unload the sorrow.\n\nSo I lived as Raiden.\n\nI believed that if I chipped away at the misery others had piled up, one day, my world would also see a dawn bright enough for the sun to rise.\n\n-...Wouldn't it be enough for me to be just an extra in a peaceful village?\n\nThat's right.\n\nI gave up happiness for happiness.\n\nIt was a terrible paradox.\n\nAnd I realized it too late.\n\nBecause I had dreamed with such fierce effort, it was already too late to turn back.\n\n-I'm tired now... I can't do this anymore...\n\nI couldn't overcome the dissonance.\n\nI couldn't achieve life.\n\nIn the end, I crumbled.\n\n***\n\nThe knot of the rope tightens brutally around my neck.\n\n\"Gah...!\"\n\nThe way of the world drags down my hanging head roughly.\n\nMy vision blurs as my breath grows fainter, painting the world in a haze.\n\n\"Ugh... Hack...!\"\n\nOnly fragments of exhaled breaths, unable to form into proper breaths, escape from between my lips.\n\nThe intermittent, agonizing moans pierce my ears sickeningly.\n\n'...How did it come to this?'\n\nA fleeting monologue in my fading consciousness.\n\nFor some reason, tears stream down my face, further blurring my vision.\n\n-I know you've always wished for a happy life.\n\n-This system can fulfill that wish of yours.\n\nThinking back, I shouldn't have accepted the offer back then.\n\nInstead of reaching out for the opportunity presented before me, I should have just broken my own neck.\n\n-Please.\n\n-Whether it's three years or four years... Please give me a chance.\n\nBlinded by false hope.\n\nI chose a foolish ideal and ended up standing before a shattered desire.\n\n'...Right, it was all my fault from the beginning.'\n\nBorn with misery in my very being.\n\nI dared to wish for happiness that was beyond my reach.\n\nPerhaps I was now paying the price for my arrogance.\n\nThe contract I made with the system had sunk into a wave of unhappiness.\n\nThe word \"hope,\" which I had scribbled on my heart as I began my second life, had transformed into a shard of pain, composed of three consonants and two vowels.\n\n\"Kuh...! Ugh...!\"\n\nIt hurts, it's agonizing.\n\nThe traces of loneliness from my past life still lingered by my side.\n\nDesperate to escape from those dreadful old days, I struggled even harder, my legs dangling in the air.\n\n\"......\"\n\nBut no matter how much time passed.\n\nMy breath didn't stop.\n\nMy lungs continued their pathetic breathing.\n\nMy heart kept beating steadily.\n\nIt was only natural.\n\nA body strengthened by mana wouldn't succumb to death just from hanging.\n\nHowever, the reason I continued to hang there, even though I knew this...\n\n...was because I truly, desperately wished for this meager breath to end.\n\nI yearned for the endless cycle of misery and the chain of sorrow to finally come to an end.\n\n\"Ugh...! Hack...!\"\n\nLet me die.\n\nI want to die.\n\nNo, I need to die.\n\nThis was my last chance.\n\nA chance to end it all and vanish into a peaceful oblivion, freer than anyone else.\n\nMy ideal was happiness.\n\nMy reality was misery.\n\nIn this reality where my ideal had vanished, there was nothing left that could be called life.\n\nSo let me die.\n\nHorribly, wretchedly, disgracefully.\n\n\"......\"\n\nThis was the predetermined ending from the very beginning.\n\nJust like the last sentence in children's fairy tales, where the protagonists always lived happily ever after.\n\nMy fairy tale was simply meant to have a tragic ending.\n\nI wasn't sad at all.\n\nDeath, that was the peace I wanted to give myself.\n\n'Yes ...This is enough. If I can just end it like this...'\n\nWith a wave of resignation, just as I was about to close my eyes...\n\nI heard a commotion outside the door, and soon, the closed door burst open with a loud bang.\n\n-BAM!\n\n\"Young master! Are you alright?!\"\n\n\"Brother! Are you okay?! I suddenly heard a groan...\"\n\nThe children rushed into my sight.\n\nThe faithful maid with brown hair.\n\nMy adorable little sister with red hair.\n\nThe golden-haired young man whom I respected immensely.\n\nAnd lastly, my former fiancée with silver hair, who once harbored feelings of guilt towards me.\n\nPeople who should no longer matter to me.\n\nThe girls, who had been wearing urgent expressions, turned pale upon seeing me.\n\n\"Rai... den...?\"\n\nIn my hazy vision...\n\nI saw their eyes trembling madly.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

The Young Master is back...?\"\n\n\"Seriously... You're just finding out now? It's been a whole week...\"\n\n\"The main house staff must be having a tough time. Cleaning up after the Young Master's messes...\"\n\n\"Well... That's what I heard, the Young Master... he's become a bit strange...\"\n\nRaiden's notoriety as a troublemaker was well-known, but within the mansion, his infamy was amplified tenfold.\n\nThe servants, who had borne the brunt of his antics, knew this better than anyone.\n\nAs a result, stories about Raiden were constantly circulating among them.\n\nPast incidents, recent rumors, and even his heroic tales from the Academy.\n\nA variety of stories made the rounds, but there was one topic that stood out from the rest.\n\nIt was...\n\n\"You're saying the Young Master has changed...?\"\n\n\"That's what I heard...! It's been almost a week since he returned to the mansion, and they say he's been holed up in his room, completely silent.\"\n\n\"No way.\"\n\nThe rumor of Raiden's transformation was a shock to the servants.\n\nThe Young Master who used to flip tables and smash ornaments during meals, causing chaos wherever he went...\n\nTo think he had become docile was an unbelievable turn of events.\n\n\"Maybe he's grounded? But the Young Master wouldn't just...\"\n\n\"I know, right...? It's strange.\"\n\n\"Should we ask someone from the main house?\"\n\n\"What would they know? They're all in a frenzy trying to figure out why the Young Master is acting like this all of a sudden.\"\n\nSpeculations ran rampant—was he being punished, was he terminally ill?—but no one could pinpoint the cause of his sudden change.\n\nThe young man remained isolated, spending his days in solitude.\n\n\"I heard Lady Ariel and his personal maid went to see him the other day, but he sent them away without even showing his face.\"\n\n\"His personal maid... You mean Rachel?\"\n\n\"Yes. She's the only servant the Young Master ever kept close...\"\n\n\"Do you think something really happened to him...?\"\n\n\"......I'm a little worried.\"\n\nDespite Raiden's past behavior that had earned him their resentment, many of the servants had known him since he was a child, and a sense of concern pervaded the mansion.\n\n\"I hope he's alright...\"\n\n\"......Me too.\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAs the mansion was steeped in a heavy atmosphere, Steinar sat at his desk, working through a mountain of paperwork.\n\n-Scratch, scratch...\n\nThe faint sound of pen against paper filled the air.\n\nHis calloused hand moved diligently, filling the blank spaces, completing one document after another.\n\nAs he continued working, a visitor arrived.\n\n-Knock, knock...\n\n\"...Duke, you summoned me.\"\n\nA young girl's voice came from behind the door.\n\nSteinar paused, setting his pen down.\n\nHe pushed the documents aside and spoke, his voice laced with fatigue.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\n-Creak...\n\nThe soft creak of the hinges broke the silence that had settled in his study.\n\nA young girl peeked her head through the open doorway.\n\n\"Ah, Rachel. I apologize for calling you at such a late hour.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Duke.\"\n\n\"Have a seat.\"\n\nSteinar gestured towards the sofa across from him.\n\nHe rubbed his weary face and met her gaze.\n\n\"I believe you have an idea why I called for you.\"\n\n\"...It's about the Young Master, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\nSteinar nodded curtly.\n\nA shadow fell over the young girl's face.\n\nSteinar frowned slightly, noticing her reaction.\n\n\"I've heard from Gilbert about the boy's condition. He said it wasn't good...\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Tell me. What exactly happened at the Academy?\"\n\nAccording to the report, Raiden's state was dire.\n\nHe had confined himself to his room, refusing to eat properly, and spending his days shrouded in a haze of deathweed smoke.\n\nAs far as Steinar could recall, Raiden might have been a troublemaker, but he was no addict.\n\n\"What could have driven him to such a state?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nThe girl bit her lip, remaining silent.\n\nHer hesitation only solidified Steinar's suspicion that something was terribly wrong.\n\nA flicker of emotion crossed his usually stoic face.\n\n\"...Is he ill?\"\n\n\"No, that's not it... but...\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\n\"He... He's been deeply hurt.\"\n\nThe hesitant girl finally spoke.\n\nShe recounted the events of the past few weeks.\n\nHow Raiden had risked his life to defend the Academy from the attack.\n\nHow he was subsequently misunderstood and ostracized by his peers.\n\nAnd how, unable to bear the weight of their accusations and his own grief, he had crumbled.\n\nSteinar listened in silence, absorbing the tragic tale.\n\n\"...That's all I know.\"\n\nA heavy quiet filled the study as Rachel finished her account.\n\nThe silence was broken by Steinar's heavy sigh.\n\n\"I don't know what to say...\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Are you telling me that boy... tried to take his own life?\"\n\nHis voice was laced with a chilling realization.\n\nRachel could only nod, her expression pained.\n\n\"...Damn it.\"\n\nSteinar cursed under his breath, his hand flying to his forehead.\n\nThe thought of his son attempting suicide was unbearable.\n\n\"...And how is he now?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure...\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you're not sure?\"\n\n\"Lady Ariel and I have been visiting the Young Master's room every day, but... he won't even speak to us. Not even when the Lady begs him through tears.\"\n\n\"This is serious...\"\n\nEven in his wildest days, Raiden had always at least pretended to listen to Ariel...\n\nSteinar's face was etched with worry.

It was a familiar nightmare.\n\nI sighed, pushing my hair away from my face.\n\n“Haah… Why am I here again…?”\n\nThis strange dream always seemed to appear at random, filled with whispers and shadows, but devoid of meaning.\n\nI frowned, about to dismiss it as another meaningless figment of my imagination…\n\n“Hey, that’s not very nice! Calling us meaningless!”\n\n“Yeah, have some respect.”\n\n“...?”\n\nI paused, my frown deepening.\n\nI lifted my head, my eyes drawn to the source of the voices.\n\nTwo young boys stood before me.\n\nThey waved at me, their expressions unreadable.\n\n“Long time no see, huh?”\n\n“It’s been almost half a month.”\n\nThey greeted me casually.\n\nI stared at them, my confusion mounting.\n\n‘What…?’\n\nI had experienced this dream many times before, but…\n\nThis had never happened.\n\n“Well, the ‘wall’ that was blocking us is gone now… So there’s nothing holding us back anymore.”\n\n“You know, that Iron Will skill of yours.”\n\nThe wall…\n\nSo the ‘wall’ they had warned me about before, the one I needed to break down… was my Iron Will skill?\n\nI tried to process the information, my mind struggling to keep up.\n\nAs I stared at them, my expression a mixture of confusion and apprehension, one of the boys, who bore a striking resemblance to Raiden, shrugged.\n\n“Well… We can explain all that later. For now, let’s focus on what’s important.”\n\n“We’ve been watching you, you know.”\n\n“Things aren’t looking so good…”\n\n“Rachel… She’s pitiful. Reminds me of Jih-ye noona.”\n\nRachel.\n\nHer name, spoken so casually, stole my breath away.\n\n-You promised you wouldn’t leave…\n\n-You’re… You’re everything to me, Young Master…\n\nThe memory of her words, filled with desperation and anguish, flashed before my eyes.\n\nA familiar pain stabbed at my chest. I grimaced, my expression hardening.\n\nNaru, his face filled with sympathy, reached out to me.\n\n“Don’t blame yourself… It couldn’t be helped.”\n\nHis words, meant to comfort me, sounded like accusations to my ears.\n\nAs if he were blaming me for everything that had happened.\n\nAnger flared within me.\n\nEven though I knew this was just a dream, I couldn’t hold back my rage.\n\n“Shut up.”\n\nWhat did he know?\n\nHow dare he presume to understand what I was going through?\n\nThe grief, the guilt, the crushing weight of responsibility.\n\nHe knew nothing of the darkness that had consumed me.\n\n“…I’m not blaming you.”\n\nNaru looked at me, his eyes filled with concern.\n\nBut his sympathy only made me feel worse.\n\nMy legs gave way, and I collapsed to the ground.\n\n“I… I don’t know what to do…”\n\nWhat was the right thing to do?\n\nHow could I possibly face Rachel, face Ariel, knowing the pain I had caused them?\n\n“I’m not Raiden… No matter how hard I try, that will never change.”\n\nTheir love wasn’t meant for me.\n\nIt was meant for Raiden.\n\nI was nothing but an imposter, a fraud who had stumbled into their lives.\n\nA hollow ache spread through my chest.\n\n“I didn’t want to deceive them… So I did what I thought was best.”\n\nDisappearing.\n\nPushing away their love.\n\n“…Even if I stayed, I could never truly belong in this world.”\n\nMy words echoed through the empty void.\n\nMy eyes burned, tears threatening to spill.\n\nBut before they could fall, Raiden spoke.\n\n“Are you sure about that?”\n\nHe tilted his head, his expression unreadable.\n\nHe tapped his lips with his finger, his gaze unwavering.\n\n“Are you absolutely certain?”\n\n“What…?”\n\n“You said it yourself, didn’t you? That you’re just a parasite wearing Raiden’s skin. Are you sure that’s all you are?”\n\nI frowned, confused by his words.\n\nHe circled me, his movements slow and deliberate.\n\n“We told you, remember? Don’t forget.”\n\n“Forget what?”\n\n“Don’t you remember? We told you, we’re not so different.”\n\n“No…”\n\nOf course I remembered.\n\nThose cryptic words, repeated over and over again.\n\nI had dismissed them as nonsense.\n\nBut now…\n\n“Why would you say that?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Do you still believe that you and Raiden are two separate entities?”\n\n“…Just spit it out!”\n\nHe didn’t react to my outburst.\n\nHis lips curled into a knowing smile.\n\nHe paused for a moment, as if savoring the anticipation, before speaking.\n\n“Let me make this clear. Listen closely, Kim Naru… No, Raiden.”\n\nYou’re not a fake.\n\nYou’re not some parasite who stole an empty shell.\n\nYou’ve always lived your life as a true and genuine being.\n\n“How’s that? Making sense now?”\n\nHe winked, a playful smirk on his face.\n\nI, on the other hand, could only stare at him in shock.\n\nHis words hit me like a bolt of lightning, shattering the foundations of everything I thought I knew.\n\nHe leaned closer, his voice a low whisper in my ear.\n\n“That’s right.”\n\nIt was never possession.\n\n“…You were reincarnated, Raiden.”\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

You seem out of it.”\n\n“Let’s give him some space. It seems like he understands the situation now.”\n\n“Yeah, he needs time to process everything…”\n\nI sat there on the ground, frozen in place.\n\nThe two boys, both reflections of myself, stared at me with a mixture of pity and concern.\n\n“…”\n\nI met their gazes, my mind racing.\n\nWaves of nausea washed over me as I struggled to make sense of everything, but I refused to shut down.\n\nI sat there for a long time, desperately searching for a flaw in their logic.\n\nFor some inconsistency, some discrepancy that would prove them wrong.\n\n“The status window… It told me that I possessed Raiden.”\n\nIt didn’t make sense.\n\nThe status window had offered me a contract, a chance to stay in this world.\n\nIt had told me, time and time again, that I was the possessor.\n\n“Something’s not adding up…”\n\n“We told you, there’s someone out there who tampered with your memories.”\n\n“Who do you think it is?”\n\nIt wasn’t really a question.\n\nMore of a statement disguised as one.\n\n“The status window… manipulated my memories…?”\n\nIt felt like I had been punched in the gut.\n\nLies.\n\nI wanted to deny it, to scream that it wasn’t true, but the words wouldn’t come out.\n\nThe realization that the status window, something I had relied on so heavily, had betrayed me… it was too much to handle.\n\n“It’s just a guess, but… If the status window is really ‘that person,’ then everything falls into place.”\n\nThe world tilted around me.\n\nWho was this person they kept talking about?\n\nI opened my mouth to ask, but they stopped me before I could speak.\n\n“We can’t tell you. It’s forbidden… by a being of absolute power…”\n\n“We don’t have the strength to defy them.”\n\n“The only hint we can give you is… he’s famous.”\n\n“Yeah, famous everywhere.”\n\nThey exchanged glances as if they had just shared some incredibly valuable piece of information.\n\nI couldn’t keep up.\n\nMy head was spinning.\n\nI closed my eyes, trying to fight off the dizziness, but it was no use.\n\nI slumped back against the ground, my body heavy with exhaustion.\n\n“Just accept it.”\n\n“This is the truth. You can’t run from it any longer, Raiden.”\n\nTheir voices washed over me, their words a relentless assault on my senses.\n\nI laughed, a dry, humorless sound.\n\n“Accept it…? How can I possibly accept this…?”\n\nIf what they were saying was true…\n\n“Then everything I went through… the hatred, the fear, the misunderstanding… it was all my fault.”\n\nThey were saying that the responsibility for all the pain and suffering I had endured…\n\nFor the fear and suspicion that had nearly driven me from this world…\n\nRested solely on my shoulders.\n\nThat all the injustice, all the anger I had felt…\n\nWas the result of my own unconscious actions.\n\n“You saw how much I suffered because of them…”\n\n“…”\n\n“You heard what I said to Rachel, to Ariel… when I decided to leave this world…”\n\nAriel, Lucy, Rachel.\n\nI had hurt them, left them with scars that might never heal.\n\n“I caused so much chaos… and now you’re telling me that I was the cause of it all…?”\n\n“…”\n\n“How can you expect me to accept that…?”\n\nTears welled up in my eyes.\n\nI wiped them away angrily, but they kept coming.\n\nBubbles of air escaped my lips, rising to the surface of the water that surrounded us.\n\n“I resented Raiden for so long… and now you’re telling me that he was me all along…?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Damn it…”\n\nA curse escaped my lips.\n\nI bit down hard, trying to contain the emotions that threatened to overwhelm me.\n\nThe two boys approached me, their expressions softening.\n\n“That’s why… you need to get a grip.”\n\n“Wallowing in self-pity won’t solve anything.”\n\nThey pulled me to my feet, their touch surprisingly strong.\n\nI swayed for a moment, my legs unsteady, before finding my balance.\n\n“Think about it. You are Raiden, through and through.”\n\n“What does that even mean…?”\n\n“It means you can finally accept the love that people like Rachel and Ariel have for you. You don’t have to push them away anymore.”\n\nYou’re Raiden, you’re Naru, you’re us.\n\nTheir words, spoken with such conviction, gave me pause.\n\nLove.\n\nPeople who loved me…?\n\nI stared at them, my mind struggling to grasp the concept.\n\nRaiden stepped forward, offering me his hand.\n\n“I understand… After all, we’re just fragments of your memories. We’re data.”\n\n“…”\n\n“All the pain you experienced, in both lives… it’s a part of us too.”\n\nHe smiled at me, his expression gentle.\n\n“We know it wasn’t easy, Naru. Life has been cruel to you… But even so…”\n\n“…”\n\n“Even so, we have to keep moving forward, Raiden.”\n\nNaru and Raiden.\n\nTwo names, two lives, both intertwined with my own.\n\n“You said you didn’t want to leave… You said you wanted to live, to be happy…”\n\n“…”\n\n“You’ll never find what you’re looking for if you keep running away.”\n\nSo take our hands, Raiden.\n\nIt’s not too late to fix this.\n\nThere are still people who care about you.\n\n“…”\n\nI stared at their outstretched hands, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nI could see my own reflection in the water, shimmering and indistinct.\n\nI took a deep breath and reached out, my fingers brushing against theirs.\n\n-Thud…\n\n“Good choice. Leave everything to us.”\n\n“Listen carefully. We’re going to fill in the gaps in your memories, in your emotions.

[T/N: Heat flower (열꽃이란) ]\n\nIt’s the red dots that bloom on your skin when you’re severely ill.\n\nA pain that lingers as a mark.\n\nThese flowers of record bloom when the illness is at its worst, or in other words, right before the body begins to recover.\n\nThat’s why it symbolizes both the most desperate moment and the most hopeful.\n\n-Choose.\n\nIt may sound paradoxical.\n\nBut this was a law befitting the truth.\n\nThe darkest dawn is also the closest to the arrival of light.\n\nThe harshest winter is also the closest season to welcoming gentle warmth.\n\nLife was no different.\n\n-Choose, Raiden.\n\nIt hurts, it hurts, it hurts so much.\n\nEven if the tears that stream down your cheeks become a sea that laps at your feet.\n\nEventually, the moment the Heat flower blooms will come.\n\nBecause there’s a limit to the misfortune that life bestows.\n\nIf you walk through a thorny path with your wretched breath, you’re bound to step on a soft snowfield someday.\n\nWe live a beautiful paradox.\n\nWe each draw our own dance lines, following the serenade that life plays.\n\n-What do you want to do?\n\nLife is a Heat flower.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to decide what kind of pain you will receive.\n\nThe choice of how to overcome that pain lies in everyone's hands.\n\nSome will move forward, breaking the Heat flower.\n\nSome will collapse, intoxicated by the dizzying scent of flowers.\n\n-Nothing will bind you. So, make a decision comfortably.\n\nThe world always asks questions.\n\nTurning your back and running away, or stubbornly taking a step forward.\n\nPeace that can tie up all the pain, or the foolishness of pushing yourself back into hell.\n\nIf you have to choose one of the two…\n\n-Which will you choose?\n\nAbout what choice you will make.\n\n***\n\n“Cough…!

Well, nothing much had changed.\n\nI had confined myself to my small room, spending each meaningless day lost in a haze of smoke and sleep.\n\nNothing had changed.\n\nIf you ask why I continued to live such a pathetic life when all the missing truths had been revealed…\n\n‘…So, what am I supposed to do here?’\n\nI was confused.\n\nI had no idea what I was supposed to do next.\n\nJust six months ago, I was the worst scoundrel in the Empire.\n\nThanks to the memories of my past life as Naru, I felt a distance of over 22 years… but the others didn’t know that.\n\nI had already hurt countless people.\n\nI had earned their hatred and contempt.\n\nEven if I knew now that I was Raiden, it was too late to fix anything.\n\nThe past was already a broken mess.\n\nAnd the current me was too weak to even attempt to clean it up.\n\n“…I wish you had told me sooner.”\n\nA bitter murmur escaped my lips, followed by a puff of smoke.\n\nIf only I had realized the truth about my past life earlier… before everything went wrong.\n\nBack when no one was hurt, when no one had left my side.\n\nBack when my heart wasn’t so broken.\n\nBack when Mother… was still alive. Maybe I could have protected those days.\n\n“…Damn it.”\n\nThe thought stabbed at my chest.\n\nI knew it was pointless to dwell on what-ifs, but I still clung to the word ‘if’ as if it could somehow save me.\n\n“I’m still the same pathetic loser, now as I was then…”\n\nI forced a self-deprecating smile, trying to shake off the thoughts that threatened to consume me.\n\nI reached for the Deathweed case by my bed, hoping to numb the turmoil within me.\n\nBut my fingers grasped at empty air.\n\nI had to drag myself out of bed.\n\nAs I stood up, a wave of dizziness washed over me. I leaned against the bedpost for support, my vision blurring for a moment.\n\nWhen I finally opened my eyes, I saw the floor littered with empty Deathweed cases.\n\n“Ah…”\n\nIt dawned on me then that the last Deathweed I smoked had been my last one.\n\nI had brought dozens of boxes to my room just last time.\n\nAnd I had gone through that mountain of Deathweed in just a few weeks.\n\n“…Did I smoke too much?”\n\nI muttered to myself, staring at the mess on the floor.\n\nWell… considering I had been practically living on the stuff, it would be more strange if I still had some left.\n\nIt looked like I had to ask Milliam to send the next month’s supply in advance.\n\n“Haa… What am I going to do…”\n\nA sigh of frustration escaped my lips.\n\nIt would take at least half a month to receive the new supply.\n\nCould I really endure that long…?\n\n“…No way I can last that long.”\n\nI frowned, my irritation growing.\n\nThen, a forgotten memory surfaced in my mind.\n\nWhen I was moving my belongings from the Academy dorm, I had sent some of the larger items to my family home in advance.\n\nAnd I vaguely remembered including a few boxes of spare Deathweed in that shipment.\n\n“Gilbert said he put all the luggage that arrived first in the storage room on the third floor…”\n\nHe had said he would move them to my room later.\n\nBut since I had locked myself in my room as soon as I got home, refusing to see anyone… those boxes must still be in the storage room.\n\nShould I call someone?\n\nI glanced at the clock on the wall.\n\nTick-tock… tick-tock…\n\nThe hands pointed to 2:30 AM.\n\nEveryone in the mansion must be asleep by now.\n\nIt seemed a little inconsiderate to wake someone up at this hour.\n\n“…I guess I have to go myself.”\n\nI groaned as I got out of bed.\n\nMy body felt heavy, weighed down by gravity after weeks of neglect.\n\nI dragged myself across the room, my movements sluggish.\n\nI could have waited a few hours.\n\nI could have waited until morning and had the servants bring it to me.\n\nBut my Deathweed-addled brain, pickled after half a month of constant consumption, was already craving the green smoke.\n\nI clenched my trembling hands into fists and opened the door.\n\n-Click, creak…\n\nThe sound of the lock disengaging was followed by the soft groan of the hinges.\n\nIt was almost comical… that the thing that finally forced me out of my self-imposed exile was a need for an antidepressant.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI walked quietly through the darkened mansion.\n\nIt was late, and apart from a few servants on night duty, everyone seemed to be asleep.\n\nI walked on, careful not to wake anyone.\n\n-Tap, tap…\n\nThe mansion was quiet, almost eerily so.\n\nAs I walked, I took in the familiar surroundings, each corner filled with memories.\n\nThe hallway I had run down countless times as a child.\n\nThe room where I had laughed and chatted with the kind servants.\n\nThe stairs where I had almost tripped over Ariel while playing.\n\nThe Duke’s study where I sometimes sneaked in to see my father working late at night.\n\n“…”\n\nFamiliar scenery.\n\nPlaces that held echoes of happier times.\n\nI tried to push away the bittersweet memories, but they clung to me, refusing to be ignored.\n\n-Tap…\n\nLost in thought, I continued walking until… I stopped.\n\nMy body seemed to remember this place, even if my mind did not.\n\nI looked up, my gaze drawn to the nameplate on the door in front of me.\n\n[Philli’s library]\n\n“Ah…”\n\nI stared at the nameplate, my breath catching in my throat.\n\nThe name ‘Philli,’ etched in gold on the silver surface.\n\nThis place… it held so many vivid memories.\n\nWhen I was younger…\n\nI used to come here every night, crying and calling for someone.\n\n“…Mother.”\n\nPhillipa Lishite… No, my mother’s study.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

At this hour?'\n\nFrowning, I found myself unconsciously drawn towards the flickering light.\n\nI crossed the hallway and descended the stairs.\n\nAs I reached the first floor, a secluded room, seemingly the source of the light, came into view.\n\nThe door was half open.\n\nI hesitated for a moment, then gently pushed it open.\n\n-Creak...\n\n\"...What is this place?\"\n\nThe interior was bathed in a soft, crimson glow.\n\nA long table ran down the center of the room, lined with neatly arranged chairs.\n\nThe shelves were stocked with various bottles of alcohol.\n\nThe scene looked like...\n\n\"...A bar?\"\n\nIt was as if an upscale tavern had been transported straight into the mansion.\n\nI had never seen this place before.\n\nA wave of confusion washed over me as I looked around.\n\n\"I'm sure this wasn't here until a couple of years ago...\"\n\n\"...Young Master?\"\n\nA deep voice suddenly came from behind me.\n\nI turned around to find an elderly gentleman standing behind the table.\n\nMy eyes widened in surprise.\n\n\"Gilbert...?

I don't think I've ever been here before...\"\n\n\"Now that you mention it, this must be your first time seeing this place, Young Master. This is, well... the Duke's personal lounge, so to speak.\"\n\n\"Lounge...?\"\n\nAt my puzzled look, Gilbert set the bottles he was holding down on the table and continued.\n\n\"You see, the Duke is quite the connoisseur of fine spirits. He always enjoys a drink after finishing his paperwork, so I prepared this space for him to enjoy it properly, rather than at his desk in the study.\"\n\n\"I distinctly remember saying it was unnecessary...\"\n\n\"Haha, and yet you find yourself here almost every day... Surely you're not trying to back out of it now?\"\n\n\"...Well, I never said I disliked it.\"\n\nFather and Gilbert bantered back and forth, each with a glass and a bottle in hand.\n\nAs I watched them, a strange sense of nostalgia washed over me. Gilbert caught my eye and smiled faintly.\n\n\"Since you're here, Young Master, would you care for a drink?\"\n\n\"...I'm not old enough to drink yet.\"\n\n\"Heh heh... That's quite a thing to say, coming from someone who used to drown himself in alcohol every day.\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm just kidding. I'll have a glass of something cold, please.\"\n\nI shrugged lightly and walked over to the table.\n\nTaking a seat a couple of spaces away from my father, I let out a heavy sigh.\n\n\"Ha...\"\n\n\"That sounds like a heavy sigh. Are you alright, Young Master?\"\n\n\"I suppose.\"\n\nI nodded, rubbing my face as if washing it with dry hands.\n\nThe truth was, nothing felt alright... but I didn't need to burden them with my troubles.\n\nI chewed on my lip absentmindedly, tapping my fingers on the table.\n\nAs silence descended upon us, a glass filled with ice and amber liquid was placed in front of me.\n\n\"Here you go. It's a fine vintage that arrived last month. I hear it's brewed by the nomads in the southwest.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Gilbert.\"\n\nAs I took the glass, a cool sensation spread across my palm.\n\nThe crimson liquid, reminiscent of the evening sunset, sloshed gently, its weight settling into my hand.\n\nI took a small sip, feeling the burn as it slid down my throat.\n\nThe alcohol spread through my empty stomach, a familiar warmth.\n\nI emptied the glass in one go and winced, savoring the bitter aftertaste.\n\n\"It's... quite strong.\"\n\n\"Take it slow, Young Master. You have a low tolerance yet you always gulp it down like that. It's no wonder you get drunk so quickly.\"\n\nGilbert chided as he refilled my empty glass.\n\nI let out a small chuckle.\n\n\"A low tolerance? You must be talking about someone else.\"\n\n\"I'm talking about you, Young Master.\"\n\n\"I can hold my liquor... Seriously.\"\n\n\"Hmm... But you always blackout after a single sip, don't you?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGilbert had a point.\n\nAt a loss for words, I fiddled with my glass.\n\nThe reflection of a black-haired boy stared back at me from the crimson surface.\n\nWith a light touch, ripples spread across the miniature pond, distorting my reflection.\n\nLost in thought, I finally spoke again.\n\n\"Actually... I remember everything.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know, back when I was acting like a drunken fool. I wasn't actually drunk back then.\"\n\nPerhaps I took after my father, a known alcohol enthusiast.\n\nI'd always had a high tolerance.\n\nI could get tipsy, but never truly drunk.\n\nNaturally, I'd never blacked out from drinking.\n\n\"So, I remember everything. Every single thing I did back then...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Every last detail.\"\n\n\"Young Master...\"\n\nGilbert's expression was a mixture of surprise and confusion.\n\nHe seemed at a loss for words for a moment before he finally spoke again.\n\n\"Are you saying... all those drunken antics you pulled were just an act?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But why...?\"\n\n\"Well...\"\n\nGilbert's eyes were filled with disbelief.\n\nI could feel my father's gaze on me from the side.\n\nI gave a bitter smile and took another sip of my drink.\n\nThe ice clinked softly against the glass, and the sharp scent of alcohol filled my senses.\n\nThe intoxicating feeling, hazy like the morning mist, spread through me. I forced another bitter smile.\n\n\"Back then... I was hurting.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"You both knew, didn't you? That I was putting on an act...\"\n\nA heavy silence fell over us.\n\nI looked at their faces, both etched with complicated emotions and nodded slowly.\n\nThey had been by my side since before I was even born.\n\nI had a feeling they might have guessed the truth behind my reckless behavior...\n\nIt seemed I was right.\n\n\"Do you perhaps... know why?\"\n\n\"I had my suspicions, Young Master, but I never knew the reason...\"\n\n\"Same here. Considering when you changed, I assumed it had something to do with Phillipa's death... but that was all.\"\n\nBoth Gilbert and Father shook their heads, their expressions heavy with concern.\n\nBitterness welled up inside me, and I clenched my fists.\n\nDespite my best efforts, my lips trembled.\n\nI pushed down the shards of emotion piercing my heart and spoke again.\n\n\"Would you... like to hear about it?\"\n\n\"...What do you mean?\"\n\n\"An old story, of course.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure if this old man is the right audience for the Young Master's tales...\"\n\nGilbert chuckled, but his eyes held a knowing glint. He reached for a new bottle from the cabinet.\n\nAs he refilled my father's and my empty glasses, he asked,\n\n\"Are you sure about this, Young Master?\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"I thought you disliked talking about that time.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nWhy was that?\n\nWhy did I suddenly feel the urge to reveal the story I had kept bottled up for so long?\n\n\"I'm fine... It's just an 'old story' now.\"\n\nPerhaps it was because of what happened yesterday.\n\nBecause Mother's love, a feeling I had tried so hard to forget, had resurfaced, stirring up a storm of emotions within me.\n\nAll the buried feelings I had kept hidden threatened to spill over.\n\n\"What do you say? It'll make for a good story over drinks.\"\n\n\"If you're sure, Young Master...\"\n\n\"...I'd like to hear it too.\"\n\nGilbert hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly.\n\nFather's gaze followed, his expression unreadable.\n\nA strange smile touched my lips as I spoke, my voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Alright. Where should I begin...? It's a rather long story.\"\n\nClick.\n\nAn old film reel started playing in my mind.\n\nI stared at the yellowed screen and began to unspool the story from beyond.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

It's been a while since I've seen you cry, Young Master.\"\n\nRaiden wiped his eyes continuously as he sniffled.\n\nGilbert patted the boy's shoulder with a gentle smile.\n\nSteiner, who had been watching the heartwarming scene, quietly emptied his glass.\n\nHe lost himself in thought for a moment, the bitter taste lingering in his mouth, and let out a sigh laced with alcohol.\n\n\"Ha...\"\n\nSteiner clenched his empty glass tightly and chewed on his lip.\n\nHis mind, slightly clouded by the alcohol, was a whirlwind of complicated emotions and thoughts, all centered around his son.\n\n-You both knew, didn't you? That I was putting on an act...\n\n-Don't look at me like that. I know I was foolish.\n\n-It's just... back then, I wasn't thinking straight...\n\nThe stories Raiden had told were dark and painful.\n\nStories of the days he had been tormented by guilt and compulsions, forcing himself into a prison of solitude.\n\nA heavy sense of helplessness washed over Steiner as he listened.\n\n\"......\"\n\nWhat could he possibly say?\n\nWhat words of comfort could he, as a father, offer to his son who was hurting so deeply?\n\nNo matter how hard he racked his brain, no suitable answer came to mind.\n\nUnable to speak, Steiner hesitated, his gaze flickering towards Raiden.\n\n\"Ugh... Hicc... Uh...\"\n\n\"There, there, Young Master. Please, stop crying now. You'll wear yourself out.\"\n\n\"I'm trying... but I can't stop...\"\n\nRaiden's face was streaked with tears.\n\nEach glistening track that ran down his cheeks was like a searing brand on Steiner's heart.\n\nHe wanted to offer words of comfort, just like Gilbert.\n\nHe wanted to hold his crying son and tell him everything would be alright.\n\nBut his mind remained blank, his tongue tied in knots.\n\n'Don't cry. Everything will be fine. There's no need to worry.'\n\nWhy were such simple words so difficult to utter?\n\nSteiner groaned inwardly, frustration welling up inside him. He sought solace in the memory of his departed wife.\n\n'...Phillipa.'\n\nHe murmured her name silently, a name etched with longing and regret.\n\nA bittersweet smile touched his lips as he recalled her fiery red hair, a sight he would never behold again.\n\nPhillipa.\n\nIf only you were here.\n\nUnlike him, so emotionally stunted and awkward, you were always so loving and affectionate.\n\nYou wouldn't have hesitated for a second.\n\nYou would have embraced our son without a moment's thought, offering him the comfort he so desperately craved.\n\n'You were what they needed... not me...'\n\nSteiner took another gulp of his drink, the bitter liquid doing little to quench the thirst of his grief.\n\nWith every sip, the weight on his shoulders grew heavier, threatening to crush him.\n\nAs he grimaced, a familiar voice echoed in his mind, a voice he had tried so hard to forget.\n\n-I told you, Shten. You tend to overthink things when it comes to the children.\n\n-No matter how awkward you feel... you can't let them feel distant from you.\n\n-So, um... What I mean is, don't overcomplicate things when dealing with the children.\n\n-Sometimes, all they need is your unadulterated sincerity.\n\n\"......\"\n\nPhillipa's advice.\n\nSteiner pondered her words, his fingers tracing the rim of his glass.\n\n'Unadulterated sincerity.'\n\nThe meaning was clear.\n\nInstead of agonizing over what to say, he simply had to show his true feelings.\n\nPhillipa had always said that.\n\nThat he should approach their children with his heart, not his head.\n\n'But...'\n\nBut was that really enough?\n\nWhat if his clumsy attempts at expressing his love only ended up hurting them further?\n\nWhat if...\n\n-Just try. Don't let fear hold you back.\n\n-It's better to do something, anything, than to stand by and watch them suffer in silence.\n\nYou're right... as always.\n\nHesitation wouldn't solve anything.\n\nHe had to be strong, to face his sons with an open heart, just like she had said.\n\n\"Raiden.\"\n\nSteiner broke the silence, his voice firm with resolve.\n\n\"Hicc... Y-yes, Father...?\"\n\nRaiden looked up, his eyes still glistening with tears.\n\nSteiner met his gaze and attempted a smile, his lips twitching awkwardly.\n\n\"Father...?\"\n\n\"Listen carefully, Raiden.\"\n\nSteiner took a deep breath and began to speak, his voice thick with emotion.\n\nHe poured out the words he had kept bottled up for so long, the words of a father finally finding their voice.\n\n\"Don't be so hard on yourself.\"\n\nI'm sorry, Phillipa.\n\nI'm not eloquent like you. I don't know if I can do this right.\n\nBut I'll try my best.\n\nFor our children, so they can find peace and rise above their despair.\n\n\"Phillipa and I... we were so happy when you were born.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Truly, it was as if we had been blessed with the entire world. You could never imagine the joy we felt.\"\n\nHe wasn't sure if his clumsy words could heal his son's wounds, but perhaps they could at least wipe away the tears and dust off the dirt.\n\n\"And it never faded. Every day with you was a dream come true.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"Back then, you and Ariel... you were our whole world.\"\n\nRaiden, and Ariel.\n\nHe would always carry the guilt of being such a stoic and distant father to them.\n\n\"......And that hasn't changed.\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"You asked me earlier... if I hated you, if I resented you for the way you acted.\"\n\nBeing a father was a new experience for him.\n\nHe was clumsy and awkward, but if his children were drowning in darkness, he would always be there to offer them a hand.\n\nBecause...\n\n\"Disappointed? Perhaps. But hate you? Never. I have always loved you, Raiden.\"\n\nBecause he was their father.\n\nSteiner felt a lump forming in his throat, threatening to choke him.\n\n\"You have nothing to apologize for. If anything, it's I who should be begging for your forgiveness.\"\n\nAfter Phillipa's passing, his sons had been left to face a cruel and unforgiving world.\n\nAnd yet, he hadn't been there for them.\n\nHe had allowed his grief and anger to consume him, relentlessly chasing after the very people who had taken her away.\n\n\"It's all my fault, every bit of it.\"\n\nHow lonely they must have felt.\n\nHe hadn't been there to offer them comfort or reassurance when they needed it most when they were struggling with the loss of their mother and the torment of their own minds.\n\nBy the time he had come to his senses, it was already too late.\n\nThe warmth, the light, the gentleness... it had all been extinguished from their eyes.\n\n\"There hasn't been a single day where I haven't regretted my actions.\"\n\nIf only he had been there for them, a source of strength and solace...\n\n\"If only things had been different... That's all I could think about, night after night.\"\n\nSteiner stood up from his chair.\n\nWith trembling legs, he took a step towards Raiden, his arms outstretched.\n\n\"Please... If you must blame someone, blame this good-for-nothing father of yours.\"\n\nTears streamed down his face, blurring his vision.\n\nSteiner cried.\n\nAnd so did Raiden.\n\nTears flowed freely, a torrent of emotions washing over them as they clung to each other.\n\nRaiden, who had been trembling in his seat, slowly raised his arms and returned his father's embrace.\n\nThe boy melted into his father's warmth.\n\n\"Father...!\"\n\nA choked sob escaped his lips.\n\nIt was a single, heart-wrenching bloom of heat flower, signaling the unraveling of years of pent-up pain and sorrow.\n\n***\n\n-Back then, you and Ariel... you were our whole world.\n\n-I have always loved you, Raiden.\n\n-Please... If you must blame someone, blame this good-for-nothing father of yours.\n\nMy father's words, filled with raw emotion, unleashed a fresh wave of tears.\n\nIt had been so long since I had heard the word 'love' directed at me, especially from him.\n\nHis words, though simple and straightforward, were my salvation.\n\nFor years, I had been haunted by a single, terrifying thought.\n\nWould my father ever... resent me for surviving at the cost of my mother's life?\n\nI had been living under the shadow of that fear.\n\nBut now, my father had single-handedly dispelled that darkness.\n\nHe had reassured me, and quieted the anxious whispers that threatened to consume me.\n\nI buried my face in his chest, letting out a sob that seemed to encompass all the pain and sorrow I had kept bottled up for so long.\n\nMy father simply held me, his hand rubbing soothing circles on my back.\n\nGilbert watched us with a soft smile on his face, quietly refilling our empty glasses.\n\n\"Haha...

The least I could do was to show her that I was alright.\n\nWith a destination in mind, I started walking again.\n\nThump... Thump...\n\nMy light footsteps echoed through the quiet hallway.\n\nAs I walked, bathed in the warm sunlight streaming through the windows, flashes of the previous night flickered through my mind.\n\n-That is a butler's duty, Little Master.\n\n-I have always loved you, Raiden.\n\nA small smile touched my lips as I recalled their words, each syllable a source of warmth that slowly melted the ice around my heart.\n\nI placed a hand over my chest, feeling a warmth spread through me.\n\n-Whoosh...\n\nA gentle winter breeze flowed through the open windows, causing the curtains to sway gently.\n\nLike a graceful dance of white silk.\n\nI paused for a moment, gazing out the window at the scenery beyond.\n\n\"......\"\n\nThe world outside seemed to shimmer before my eyes, the bright morning light painting the white curtains with hues of gold.\n\nThe wind felt cool against my skin, and the occasional ray of sunshine that touched my face held a surprising warmth.\n\nThe scenery seemed to ripple and shift before my eyes.\n\nSimple sensations, weaving together to form something... extraordinary.\n\nSomething strange was happening to me.\n\nIt was nothing special, really.\n\nJust an ordinary view from a window.\n\nAnd yet, it filled me with an indescribable sense of wonder, as if I were witnessing something truly magical.\n\nFor the first time in as long as I could remember, I was seeing the world... beautifully.\n\n'This is... strange...'\n\nMy heart pounded in my chest, a strange tightness constricting my throat.\n\nTears welled up in my eyes, threatening to spill over.\n\nIt was as if a dam had broken inside of me, releasing a torrent of emotions I had kept bottled up for far too long.\n\nA wave of relief washed over me, followed by a bittersweet ache.\n\nMy heart ached, and yet, there was a lightness to it, a sense of freedom I had never experienced before.\n\nMy vision blurred as tears streamed down my face.\n\n-It's okay to let go of the pain, Raiden.\n\nI heard their voices, echoing in my ears.\n\nKim Naru, and Raiden.\n\nWe had endured so much pain together, finding solace in each other's presence.\n\n-You've suffered enough.  Brighter days are coming.\n\n-Life is like a heat flower.\n\n-Happiness awaits you, Raiden.  We promise.\n\nThe tears wouldn't stop flowing.\n\nIt was as if all the pain, all the sorrow I had kept buried deep inside, was melting away like snow under the warmth of the spring sun.\n\nA single word echoed in my mind.\n\nHope.\n\nThe hope that bloomed even in the harshest of winters, a testament to the resilience of life.\n\n-No one is born to suffer.\n\nEveryone deserves happiness.\n\nSome just have to wait a little longer for their spring to arrive.\n\nAnd when it does, it will be all the more beautiful for having weathered the storms.\n\nYou, and I.\n\nWe will find our happiness.\n\nBelieve it.\n\n-Believe in your future.\n\nFor some, simply believing in the possibility of happiness was enough to set them free.\n\nAnd I realized, with a sudden clarity, that I was one of those people.\n\nAll those years I had spent trapped in my own personal hell, haunted by guilt and loneliness...\n\nPerhaps all I had needed was someone to tell me that it was okay to hope, that happiness was within my reach.\n\n\"Hicc... Ugh...\"\n\nStanding there, bathed in the warm glow of the morning sun, I finally allowed myself to cry.\n\nI had never cried so freely, so openly in my entire life.\n\nAnd yet, it felt... right.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

It was like I lost control...'\n\nBut even with my tear-streaked face and the lingering ache in my chest, I couldn't shake the feeling that something had shifted within me.\n\nIt was as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders, my body feeling lighter than it had in years.\n\nThump... Thump...\n\nWith a newfound sense of clarity, I continued down the hallway towards Ariel's room.\n\n'Come to think of it, this is the first time I've visited her since we arrived at the mansion.'\n\nHesitation flickered within me, but I pushed it aside and raised my hand to knock gently on the door.\n\n-Knock...

It’s a mess.”\n\n“…It’s your fault, you know.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I know.”\n\nI patted her head soothingly, drawing comfort from the warmth of her small form nestled against mine.\n\nEtching the feeling deep into my heart, I finally spoke.\n\n“I’m so sorry, Ariel.”\n\n“.......”\n\n“I’ve done a lot of thinking, and I realize now how wrong I was. I was foolish, reckless…”\n\nI had to apologize.\n\nTo all those I had hurt with my actions.\n\nEven if it was my own grief that had led me to take up the sword in the first place… the moment I turned it on others, I became responsible for all the misfortune that followed.\n\nA simple truth that even the wind seemed to know.\n\nAnd yet, I had been blind to it.\n\nBlinded by my own pain, I had lashed out, hurting everyone around me with the shards of my own self-loathing.\n\n‘The Empire’s most despicable young master…’\n\nPerhaps it was a title I deserved.\n\nI swallowed down the bitter taste in my mouth, forcing myself to focus on the present.\n\nI held Ariel close for a while longer, cherishing the silence that had fallen between us.\n\nAnd then, I heard it.\n\nA small, hesitant voice that seemed to echo my own fears.\n\n“…Brother?”\n\n“Yes, Ariel?”\n\n“Does this mean… you won’t leave us…?”\n\nHer voice trembled with unshed tears as she clutched at my sleeve, her grip surprisingly strong for someone so small.\n\n“I don’t want you to… to try and… die again…”\n\n“…..”\n\n“I… I don’t know what I’d do if something happened to you…”\n\nThe fact that she felt the need to even ask such a thing…\n\nIt was a stark reminder of the trauma I had inflicted upon her.\n\nMy heart ached at the thought, and I had to fight back the urge to pull her close and apologize over and over again.\n\n“Don’t worry, Ariel. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always be here for you…”\n\nI was cut off by a soft knocking on the door.\n\n-Knock… Knock…\n\nThe sound was insistent, breaking the fragile peace that had settled over the room.\n\nI tried to ignore it, to finish what I was saying, but the voice that followed made me pause.\n\n-Miss Ariel… are you in there?\n\nIt was Rachel.\n\nHer voice was soft, melodic, yet there was a hint of urgency in it that made my heart skip a beat.\n\nBoth Ariel and I turned towards the door, our names leaving our lips in unison.\n\n““Rachel…?””\n\nAs if on cue, Rachel continued speaking, her voice laced with concern.\n\n-The Young Master… he’s gone missing.\n\n-I’ve searched his bedroom, the training grounds, even the library… but he’s nowhere to be found.\n\n-…I fear… he may have left the mansion.\n\nIt was clear that Rachel had completely misunderstood the situation.\n\n-I knew this day might come… that he might disappear again… but…\n\n-It still hurts more than I could have imagined…\n\n-It’s as if… the world has lost all its color…\n\nHer words were spoken in a flat monotone, but I could hear the telltale tremor in her voice, the way she choked back a sob.\n\nShe was trying to be strong, but she was hurting just as much as Ariel.\n\nAs if to prove my point, Ariel stood up and marched towards the door.\n\nWithout a word, she flung it open, revealing a very surprised Rachel standing in the hallway.\n\n-I just thought… that you should know… so you wouldn’t… worry too much…\n\n-So… I came to tell you…\n\nRachel’s voice trailed off, her usual cheerfulness replaced by a hollow emptiness.\n\nHer breathing was shallow, as if she were on the verge of breaking down.\n\n“Why would he leave?”\n\nAriel’s voice was firm, her small frame radiating an unexpected fierceness.\n\n“He’s not going anywhere!”\n\nShe grabbed Rachel’s arm and pulled her into the room, effectively cutting off her protest.\n\nAnd that was how our eyes met.\n\n“Y-Young Master…?”\n\nRachel’s eyes widened, her gaze locking onto mine as if time itself had stopped.\n\nFor a moment, she simply stared at me, her expression a mixture of shock and disbelief.\n\nThen, as the realization of what she was seeing sunk in, her eyes filled with tears, her lips trembling slightly.\n\nShe looked… exactly how Ariel had looked just a few hours earlier.\n\nGuilt stabbed at my heart, sharp and unrelenting.\n\nWas I really so blind to the pain I was causing those around me?\n\nI forced a smile, trying to lighten the mood.\n\n“Haha… Well, this is… awkward, isn’t it…?”\n\nIt was a lame attempt at humor, but it was all I could manage at that moment.\n\nTo my surprise, Rachel didn’t laugh.\n\nInstead, her eyes welled up with tears, and she launched herself at me, wrapping her arms around me in a tight embrace.\n\n“Young Master…!”\n\nI stumbled back slightly, caught off guard by her sudden display of emotion.\n\nBefore I could react, Ariel had joined the hug, her small arms wrapping around my waist.\n\n“Brother…!”\n\n“Young Master…!”\n\nI couldn’t help but laugh, a genuine laugh this time, as I found myself sandwiched between two crying girls.\n\nIt was strange.\n\nI had spent hours trying to comfort Ariel, and now here I was, comforting two crying girls instead of one.\n\nI guess this was karma for all the trouble I had caused.\n\nWho was I to complain?\n\nWith a sigh, I returned their embrace, holding them close as they cried it out.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Come on, let’s sit down.”\n\nTo my relief, they didn’t put up much of a fight.\n\nI guided them over to the sofa and sat down, flanking them on either side.\n\nPerhaps it was the soft cushions or the warmth of our combined body heat, but as we settled into a comfortable silence, a sense of peace settled over me.\n\nI leaned back, closing my eyes for a moment as I listened to the soft sounds of their breathing.\n\nAriel and Rachel were now leaning against me, their heads resting on my shoulders.\n\nTheir eyes were still red and puffy from crying, but there was a sense of contentment in their expressions that warmed my heart.\n\n“Heh…”\n\nI couldn’t help but chuckle softly.\n\nI shouldn’t be laughing.\n\nAnd yet, the sight of these two girls, who had every right to hate me, clinging to me with such trust and affection… it filled me with a warmth I hadn’t realized I was missing.\n\n“Is this amusing to you, Young Master?”\n\nRachel’s voice was sharp, laced with a hint of annoyance.\n\nShe turned her head away, as if embarrassed to have been caught crying.\n\nBut even her attempt to appear angry was adorable.\n\nI almost blurted out the words before I could stop myself…\n\n“Well, you are rather cute when you’re flustered.”\n\nOops.\n\nToo late.\n\nI looked up to see Rachel staring at me, her eyes wide with surprise.\n\n“Ehhh…?”\n\nHer voice came out as a soft squeak, and I watched in amusement as a bright red blush spread across her cheeks.\n\n“Um… I… What…?”\n\nShe was completely flustered, her usual composure nowhere to be found.\n\nIt was… strangely endearing.\n\nRachel was always so composed, so in control of her emotions… it was almost as if the events of the past few weeks had stripped away her carefully constructed walls, revealing the vulnerable girl beneath.\n\nA strange tightness gripped my chest, and I stood up abruptly.\n\n“Ariel… Rachel…”\n\nI turned to face them, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nThere was something I needed to say, something I should have said a long time ago.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\nI didn’t even know where to begin.\n\nHow could I possibly put into words the depth of my regret, the shame I felt for all the pain I had caused?\n\nSo I kept it simple.\n\nBut the sincerity in my voice was undeniable.\n\n“I never meant to hurt either of you…”\n\nAnd yet, that was exactly what I had done.\n\nIn the most cruel, most selfish way imaginable.\n\nI couldn’t even begin to imagine what they must have gone through, seeing me like that, on the brink of death.\n\nThe sheer terror, the helplessness, the despair…\n\n-Brother!

Please!!”\n\nPerhaps it was because she had clearly witnessed the tragedy of the person she relied on the most, but Lucy was out of her mind.\n\nWhen she sat still, the heartbreaking scene kept flashing back in her mind.\n\nEvery night when she closed her eyes, the image of him hanging by a crude noose flickered before her.\n\nTears flowed freely at any given moment.\n\nShe would throw up every meal she ate.\n\nShe couldn’t sleep for fear of the horrific nightmares.\n\nThe girl, who had lost her light, became noticeably haggard, and her appearance gradually transformed into that of a wreck with each passing day.\n\n‘Raiden… Raiden…’\n\nAll she could do was burrow under the covers and repeat the name she yearned for.\n\nShe was terribly powerless.\n\nIt was as if the world she used to see with her blue eyes had turned completely black.\n\n‘R-Raiden… I’ll untie you soon, j-just… hang in there…!!’\n\nLucy bit her nails.\n\nThe feeling of that day, when she had tried to untie the noose with her fingertips, was still vivid in her memory.\n\nThat was why Lucy bit her nails.\n\nBecause the horrifying memory that churned her stomach wouldn't go away.\n\nThe girl locked herself in a dark room.\n\nJust like the boy had done, she roughly shoved herself into the deathly silence.\n\nSilence makes you reflect on life.\n\nWhether those were happy memories or unhappy memories, it didn't matter.\n\n‘Just… disappear… all of it…’\n\n‘Disappear from my sight, please… That’s my last request…’\n\nThe memories the girl reflected on were undeniably unhappy.\n\nTragedy is a dark curtain that conceals the stage of life.\n\nLucy was left there alone.\n\nOn the stage that no longer seemed to have any meaning because the curtain had fallen and only darkness remained.\n\n‘Raiden…’\n\nEvery day was overflowing with sorrow.\n\nThat was how the girl lived for a month.\n\nBut in the end, even she got tired.\n\nShe had reached her mental limit.\n\nIt was a faint hope that held her together, forcing her out of the resignation that threatened to consume her.\n\n‘It’s okay even if Raiden pushes me away… So, just once…’\n\nJust once would be enough.\n\nEven if it was just a fleeting ember of hope, fated to be extinguished quickly.\n\nShe wanted to see the boy.\n\nShe wanted to feel his dear face, his scent, his warmth once more.\n\nLucy left the despairing room.\n\nWith faltering steps, she moved to find her light.\n\n“Please wait here for a moment, Your Highness. I will bring Duke Lishite right away.”\n\n“…Yes.”\n\nAnd so, the girl was here now.\n\nThe Lishite Dukedom.\n\nLucy stepped into the luxurious drawing room and stood there blankly.\n\nBecause she hadn't slept properly for days, her mind was completely out of it.\n\nIt was dark.\n\nShe couldn't see an inch ahead, as if all the light in the sky had been turned off.\n\nLucy continued to wait with the heart of a candle that flickered out every time the wind blew.\n\n‘I'm scared… And lonely…’\n\nThe girl swallowed the monologue inside her.\n\nOnly one person had distanced themselves from her, but why did she feel as if everything in the world had become opaque?\n\nA terrible wave of nausea rose within her.\n\nWhile she was groaning, pressing her hand to her forehead…\n\nThe closed door of the drawing room flew open, and several sets of footsteps rushed in.\n\n“Your Highness…!!”\n\nIt was the sound of several people, but Lucy could clearly distinguish it.\n\nThe presence of the boy she longed for.\n\n“Raiden…?”\n\nThe girl lifted her lowered head and looked ahead.\n\nHer wavering gaze wandered for a moment before landing on the familiar shade of black hair that reminded her of the night sky.\n\n“I apologize for the delay. It was such a sudden…”\n\n“Raiden!!”\n\nBefore the boy could even finish his sentence, Lucy jumped to her feet.\n\nThe world spun around her.\n\nIt was difficult to keep her balance because she had no strength left, but she moved her legs.\n\nShe staggered like a drunkard.\n\nAs she continued her shabby movements, she finally reached Raiden and reached out to him.\n\n“Raiden…!”\n\nJust as she was about to reach him…\n\nHer unsteady steps caused her weight to shift.\n\nHer balance crumbled.\n\nHer twisted ankle landed awkwardly on the ground.\n\nThe sharp pain was immediately followed by a terrifying sense of weightlessness.\n\n‘…Ah.’\n\nShe was falling.\n\nWith a faint murmur, the girl squeezed her eyes shut.\n\nHer body wasn’t in any condition to withstand a fall; she was bound to get hurt.\n\nLucy braced herself for the impact.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t the cold, hard floor that greeted her.\n\nIt was the warm embrace of another.\n\n“Are you alright?”\n\nA familiar voice rang in her ears.\n\nLucy blinked her dazed eyes open and looked up.\n\n“You could have been hurt.”\n\nIt was Raiden.\n\nHe had caught her in his arms as she fell.\n\nThe gentle resonance of his voice, filled with concern, gradually chipped away at the darkness that had enveloped her vision.\n\n“You look exhausted… You’ve lost weight, and your complexion is pale.”\n\n“…Raiden.”\n\n“Are you alright, Your Highness?”\n\nThe boy was looking down at her with a worried expression.\n\nHis short words were overflowing with genuine concern.\n\n“Why do you wear such a sorrowful expression…?”\n\nA warm palm caressed her cheek.\n\nFor a moment, Lucy wondered if this was all a dream.\n\nThe Raiden she had last parted ways with had been filled with sorrow and venom.\n\nBut the Raiden before her now wasn’t like that at all.\n\nThis was the Raiden she knew, the kind and caring friend she held dear.\n\nShe had been prepared to be coldly rejected, but the current situation was far beyond her expectations.\n\n‘…Is this really a dream?’\n\nA fleeting dream that had appeared because she had wished for it too deeply.\n\nLucy suddenly felt afraid.\n\nIf all of this was just a dream, she didn't think she could bear the despair of waking up.\n\n“Your Highness… You’re crying…”\n\nBut as if to contradict the girl’s worries…\n\nThe gentle voice that reached her ears.\n\nThe familiar scent that brushed past the tip of her nose.\n\nThe warmth of his hand on her face.\n\nThey all made her realize that this moment was definitely real.\n\n“Ah…”\n\nHer tears flowed like a sudden downpour.\n\nLucy, who had been frozen for a moment, finally let out a sob, her voice trembling.\n\n“Raiden…”\n\n“Yes, Your Highness.”\n\n“Is it really… you, Raiden…?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Really, really… really… Raiden…?”\n\nThe girl mumbled the same question over and over again.\n\nRaiden answered her soothingly, his voice even gentler than before.\n\n“I am here, Your Highness.”\n\nHis words were like an echo of a childhood memory.\n\nA voice that always quietly approached and comforted her whenever she was crying her eyes out over something trivial.\n\nOnly then did Lucy believe that the being in front of her wasn’t a figment of her imagination.\n\n“Raiden…!!”\n\nShe threw her arms around him, wanting nothing more than to feel his warmth envelop her.\n\nOf course, even a simple hug wasn’t easy for a girl who had no strength left.\n\nAs if sensing her heart…\n\nRaiden quietly lifted his arms and hugged her back.\n\n“Huu…! Sniff… Waaah…!”\n\nAt the gentle patting on her back, Lucy finally burst into tears.\n\nThe boy held her tight, saying nothing as he let her cry it out.\n\n“It’s alright, Your Highness… Everything’s alright now…”\n\nHe whispered soothingly, trying to calm her trembling shoulders.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I gazed silently at the warmth she emanated.\n\n“Raiden…”\n\nEven in her sleep, she mumbled my name, her voice thick with exhaustion. A stray tear traced a path down her cheek.\n\nI gently wiped it away with my fingertip.\n\nOur reunion, after almost a month, was filled with a maelstrom of emotions.\n\nMy liege was in a state of utter disarray.\n\nDark circles stained the skin beneath her eyes, her fingernails were bitten to the quick, and her hair was a tangled mess.\n\nLucy’s condition was dire.\n\n“…What in the world…”\n\nWhat in the world had happened?\n\nI couldn’t bring myself to voice the question.\n\nI knew, deep down, that it was none other than I who had driven this fragile girl to such a state.\n\nI clamped my mouth shut, the events of yesterday replaying in my mind, each memory a fresh stab to my heart.\n\n“…Sleep well”\n\nI murmured, my voice heavy with guilt.\n\nHolding the fading blonde close, I tried to gather my turbulent emotions.\n\nAs I sat there in silence, I gradually became aware of the numerous gazes on us.\n\nThe servants were staring.\n\nEven Gilbert, who had accompanied me to the drawing room, was among them.\n\nTheir eyes were wide with shock.\n\n“…Ah.”\n\nIt dawned on me then that our current state was not… ideal.\n\nI had, after all, reduced the Empire’s treasured Golden Flower to tears. Not only that, I had driven her to the point of fainting.\n\nWhat kind of person could possibly reduce a princess to such a state?\n\nThey must all be thinking the same thing.\n\nOnly Ariel and Rachel, who knew the whole story, looked at us with complicated expressions.\n\n“Brother…”\n\n“Young Master…”\n\nTheir voices were laced with worry as they approached me.\n\nI tried to smile, but it felt unnatural, like a poorly crafted mask, and did nothing to convey the turmoil I felt inside.\n\nMy mind was in disarray.\n\nPushing down the pain that clung to my heart, I rose to my feet.\n\nI couldn’t let Lucy stay like this.\n\nGently lifting her limp body, I turned to Gilbert.\n\n“Please show me to a spare room. Her Highness needs to rest.”\n\n“Ah… Yes, Young Master.”\n\nGilbert, who had been lost in thought, finally nodded.\n\nFollowing the old butler as he hurried off, I walked in silence, my heart heavy with guilt and worry.\n\n***\n\nHow much time had passed?\n\nThe girl’s eyelids fluttered open.\n\nA dark, unfamiliar ceiling swam into her blurry vision.\n\nAs Lucy’s mind slowly came into focus, she realized that she was lying beneath an unfamiliar ceiling.\n\nShe tried to sit up, but a wave of exhaustion washed over her, pinning her to the bed.\n\n“…My head…”\n\nShe winced, pressing a hand to her throbbing temples.\n\nHer vision swam in and out of focus, further disorienting her.\n\nLucy let out a shaky breath.\n\nSleep threatened to claim her with each exhale.\n\nShe forced her heavy eyelids open, trying to get her bearings.\n\nWhere… am I…?\n\nThe first question that came to mind was, naturally, her current location.\n\nThe heavy shadows in the room made it difficult to see clearly, but she could at least tell that this wasn’t her room.\n\nA wave of confusion washed over her.\n\nShe pushed it aside, trying to recall what had happened.\n\nI went to see Raiden…\n\nShe had gone to the Lishite Dukedom without a second thought.\n\nShe had made her way to the drawing-room, and then…\n\n“Raiden…!”\n\nA spark of blue flickered in her shadowed eyes.\n\nThe name escaped her lips before she could stop herself, a desperate plea lost in the silence.\n\nLucy tried to sit up again, ignoring the feeling that her body was about to fall apart.\n\nShe had to see Raiden.\n\nThere were things she had to tell him.\n\nBut her body refused to cooperate.\n\nThe fatigue that had been accumulating over the past month weighed her down, heavy and relentless.\n\nNo… I have to see him…\n\nLucy bit her lip, her vision blurring with tears as a wave of helplessness washed over her.\n\nJust as the tears threatened to spill over, a calm voice reached her ears.\n\n“You’re awake.”\n\nLucy froze, her heart leaping at the sound of the voice she had been longing to hear.\n\n“Ra-iden…?”\n\nHer voice trembled as she spoke, a mixture of emotions clogging her throat.\n\n“Yes, Your Highness.”\n\n“Raiden… Is it really you…?”\n\nShe asked again, unable to believe her ears.\n\nAs if to quell her disbelief, the boy who had been shrouded in shadows stepped forward.\n\n“I am here… Your Highness.”\n\nHis black hair reminded her of the night sky. His black eyes, usually so full of life and warmth, were now tinged with a deep sadness. He offered her a small, hesitant smile.\n\nAs his features came into focus, Lucy felt the tears finally spill over.\n\n“Raiden…!”\n\nShe tried to sit up again, but this time, a hand gently pressed against her forehead, urging her to stay down.\n\n“Rest, Your Highness. You need to recover your strength.”\n\nHis voice was reassuring as he added,\n\n“Do not worry yourself. I will stay by your side until you have fully recovered.”\n\nHis touch was gentle as he brushed a stray strand of hair from her cheek.\n\nThe warmth of his hand seemed to settle the turmoil within her.\n\nLucy finally relaxed back against the pillows, her blonde hair fanning out around her.\n\nRaiden sat down on the edge of the bed and took her hand in his.\n\nHis touch sent a jolt through her, warm and familiar.\n\nLucy couldn’t stop the rush of emotions that surged through her at the feeling of his hand in hers.\n\n“I’m sorry…”\n\n“Your Highness?”\n\n“I’m sorry for coming after you… I’m sorry… Raiden…”\n\nHer voice was thick with sorrow, her words echoing in the silent room.\n\n“You said… you hated me… You told me to go away… But… I still came after you…”\n\nShe remembered the look on his face, the resignation and resentment, the venom in his eyes as he stared into the distance.\n\n“I thought… I shouldn’t… But… Without you… I don’t think I can go on…”\n\nLucy choked back a sob, her words tumbling out in a jumbled mess as her emotions threatened to overwhelm her.\n\n“Please… Raiden… Please…”\n\nShe remembered the loneliness she had felt when Raiden had suddenly disappeared.\n\nThe suffocating sense of loss that had clung to her every waking moment.\n\nNow that she had finally found him again… Now that he had come back to her…\n\n“I don’t want to… Please, don’t…”\n\nThe thought of losing him again, of facing that unbearable emptiness, filled her with terror.\n\n“…Don’t leave me.”\n\nHer voice was a broken whisper, her blue eyes, usually so full of life, now dull with pain.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Please, get some rest. You’ve been working too hard lately.\n\nFortunately, my sincerity seemed to have reached them.\n\nThe servants, who had initially been wary and stiff around me, gradually began to open up.\n\nAs I busied myself with daily life, time flew by like the wind.\n\nBefore I knew it, only two weeks remained until the Academy reopened.\n\nThe end of January was fast approaching.\n\nNow, with the promise of spring just around the corner, I was spending time with the people I cherished most.\n\n“And then, you know what Brother did…? He took first place in the Academy practice duel…!”\n\n“Oh my… You did, Young Master?”\n\n“It’s true, Gilbert!”\n\n“Raiden, excelling at the Academy… Hmm, how unexpected.”\n\nThe atmosphere in the room was warm and inviting.\n\nAriel was chatting animatedly with Gilbert and Father, who were seated on the sofa.\n\nThe fireplace cast a gentle glow on their faces, creating a picture of perfect domestic bliss.\n\nI leaned against the window, taking in the peaceful scene.\n\nLost in the tranquility of the moment, I took a sip of the tea Gilbert had prepared for me.\n\nAs I savored the brief respite, Lucy’s voice, soft and hesitant, reached my ears.\n\n“Somehow… I feel like I’m imposing.”\n\n“What do you mean, Your Highness?”\n\n“It’s just… I feel like I’m intruding on your family time…”\n\nA wistful smile touched her lips, and her blue eyes, usually so full of life, held a hint of uncertainty.\n\nIt seemed that staying at the mansion for the past few weeks had been weighing on her mind.\n\nIt’s really no trouble at all…\n\nThe truth was, Lucy was staying at the mansion because of me.\n\nI was the one who had insisted she stay, worried that she hadn’t fully recovered from the events of “that day.”\n\nA wry smile touched my lips.\n\nI hadn’t meant to burden her with my own troubles.\n\n“There’s no one in this mansion who would find Your Highness’s presence bothersome.”\n\n“But still…”\n\n“On the contrary, I’m glad you’re here. That you stayed for me.”\n\nMy words were sincere, devoid of any pretense.\n\nKeeping Lucy at the mansion was also for my own sake.\n\nI, too, was still grappling with the remnants of my past sorrows.\n\nJust as even the grandest forest began as a tiny sapling, the happiness I had vowed to find was still but a fragile sprout.\n\nIt was only natural.\n\nAfter spending so long trapped in a prison of my own making, consumed by compulsions and loneliness, it was too early to even speak of happiness.\n\nI’m still the same…\n\nI was still tormented by nightmares.\n\nI was still haunted by hallucinations and phantom pains.\n\nI was still clinging to the smoke of the deathweed for solace.\n\nThat was why I needed Lucy.\n\nI needed more people, more warmth, more love in my life.\n\n“Because you stayed, Your Highness… each day is filled with a brighter light.”\n\nSetting down my teacup, I gently took Lucy’s hand in mine.\n\nHer skin was soft and warm beneath my fingertips. I interlaced my fingers with hers, a small smile gracing my lips.\n\n“Thank you, as always, my liege.”\n\nI expressed my gratitude, my voice laced with sincerity.\n\nLucy stared at me for a moment, her expression unreadable, before dropping her gaze to her lap.\n\n“Raiden is… well, you’re… dangerous…”\n\nShe mumbled, her cheeks flushed for some reason.\n\nDangerous? What did she mean by that?\n\nI was about to ask her to elaborate, but a voice interrupted me.\n\n“Young Master.”\n\nI turned to see Rachel approaching, a tray in her hands.\n\nShe walked with her usual grace, her movements fluid and elegant as she refilled our teacups.\n\n“…Wow.”\n\nLucy took a large gulp of her tea, as if parched, and let out a small gasp of delight.\n\n“Rachel, your tea-making skills just keep getting better and better…”\n\n“You flatter me, Your Highness.”\n\n“I mean it. It’s even better than the tea served by the royal maids.”\n\nLucy’s eyes sparkled with genuine admiration as she looked at the younger girl.\n\nRachel blushed under her praise.\n\nAs I listened to their exchange, I gently tapped the space beside me on the sofa.\n\n“Come sit with us, Rachel. You can put the tray down.”\n\n“Yes, Young Master.”\n\nWe sat together, chatting amongst ourselves.\n\n“It’s hard to believe the holidays are almost over… Time flies, doesn’t it?”\n\n“It really does… So much has happened, it feels like it’s all gone by in the blink of an eye.”\n\n“How are you feeling these days, Raiden? The nightmares, the hallucinations…”\n\n“They’re… still there. These things don’t just go away overnight…”\n\n“I suppose not…”\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nTheir faces fell at my words.\n\nI offered them a reassuring smile, my voice soft as I spoke.\n\n“But don’t worry. It’s slow going, but… I’m definitely getting better.”\n\n“Really…?”\n\n“Truly?”\n\n“Didn’t I tell you? I’m done with lying.”\n\nI was still living with the fever dream.\n\nBut even so…\n\nI forced my lips into a smile, hoping to reassure the two girls in front of me.\n\n“It’ll get better. I know it will.”\n\nI had to believe that.\n\nI wanted to believe it.\n\nI would believe it.\n\n“It will all work out, Young Master.”\n\n“Yes… It will all be okay, Raiden.”\n\n“Of course it will.”\n\nRachel, who had waited patiently for me to return from the darkness.\n\nAriel, who had welcomed me back with open arms.\n\nLucy, who had accepted me despite all the pain I had caused her.\n\nFather and Gilbert, who had shown me that I was still worthy of love.\n\nFor their sake, I had to keep moving forward, towards the light.\n\nIt was the only way I could repay them, the only way I could atone for my sins.\n\nIt was the best, the greatest gift I could offer to my mother, who had brought me into this world.\n\n“…”\n\nI pushed aside the thoughts swirling in my mind and reached out, taking both girls’ hands in mine.\n\n“Young Master…?”\n\n“Raiden…?”\n\nTheir hands were warm in mine, chasing away the lingering chill from the teacups.\n\nA comforting warmth spread through me.\n\nSavoring the feeling, I spoke, my voice soft with emotion.\n\n“Thank you. Both of you.”\n\n“Heehee… You’ve been saying ‘thank you’ a lot lately, haven’t you?”\n\n“Have I?”\n\nI chuckled sheepishly, averting my gaze.\n\nAs I fiddled with the warmth of their hands in mine, the memories of recent days flickered before my eyes.\n\n-So, will you…stay by my side?\n\n-Will you…give me another chance…?\n\nTo Rachel.\n\n-I may have hurt you deeply, Your Highness, but if you would allow me…\n\n-I wish to remain by your side.\n\nTo Lucy.\n\nI had asked for their permission to remain by their side, and they had agreed without hesitation.\n\nPerhaps it was their answers, their unwavering acceptance, that had saved me.\n\nBecause of them…\n\nI was able to stand here, now, surrounded by this comforting warmth.\n\nHow could I not say thank you?\n\nI basked in the warmth of their presence, my heart full.\n\nA comfortable silence fell over us.\n\nSuddenly, Ariel, who had been sitting quietly on the sofa, shot to her feet, her eyes wide with excitement.\n\n“Wow…!”\n\nShe rushed towards the window.\n\n“It’s snowing! It’s snowing!”\n\nI followed her gaze, my heart lifting at the sight that greeted me.\n\nThe sky was dark, but a blanket of white was already beginning to cover the ground.\n\nSnowflakes swirled and danced in the air, a mesmerizing ballet of winter’s first embrace.\n\nThe first snow of the season.\n\nIt always seemed to arrive so unexpectedly, a magical transformation of the familiar landscape.\n\nI pushed aside my musings and let the beauty of the falling snow wash over me.\n\n“Brother, let’s go outside tomorrow! I want to see the snow up close! It’s been ages!”\n\nAriel turned to me, her eyes shining with excitement. I smiled at her enthusiasm, my heart warming at the sight of her bright, cheerful face.\n\n“Alright.”\n\n“Let’s do that. There’s somewhere I need to go anyway.”\n\n“Somewhere you need to go? Where?”\n\n“You’ll see.”\n\nAriel tilted her head, her brow furrowed in confusion at my cryptic answer.\n\nI chuckled softly at her curiosity, then turned back to the window.\n\nThe night sky was a canvas of darkness, dotted with the faint glow of the moon peeking through the swirling snow.\n\nI watched as the snowflakes danced and twirled, illuminated by the ethereal light, and a quiet thought bloomed in my mind.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

You're all dressed up.\"\n\nAriel's question was almost a whine, demanding an answer.\n\nI chuckled softly.\n\nNow that she mentioned it, I had brushed aside her question yesterday.\n\nGlancing down at her fiery red hair, I spoke, my voice measured.\n\n\"It's not that far... We're going to the Forest of Rest.\"\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nAriel let out a soft gasp as the name left my lips.\n\nShe stared at me blankly for a moment, then seemed to collect herself, her eyes darting nervously towards me.\n\n\"Brother...\"\n\nHer gaze was filled with worry, her lips trembling slightly.\n\nI couldn't help but smile, reaching out to gently stroke her hair.\n\n\"Don't worry, it's going to be alright.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"It's a place we have to visit someday.\"\n\nMy voice was deliberately calm, masking the turmoil brewing within me.\n\nThe Forest of Rest. It was a place we had to pass through to reach the hope I had promised them.\n\nWe set off towards our destination.\n\nCrunch... Crunch...\n\nWith each step, the snow crunched beneath our feet.\n\nThe snowflakes that had fallen throughout the night had transformed the world into a pristine white canvas.\n\nThe winter wind whispered through the trees, sending the snow cascading down from the bare branches.\n\nFragments of the season are scattered around us.\n\nHolding Ariel's hand tightly, I led the way through the snow-covered path.\n\nAfter some time,\n\nour white footprints finally reached their destination.\n\nWe paused, our gazes fixed on the forest that lay before us.\n\n\"We're here...\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\nThe Forest of Rest.\n\nA small, tranquil forest nestled near the Lishite estate.\n\nHome to a variety of trees and flowers that bloomed throughout the year, it was a place where nature's beauty truly shone.\n\nIt was also said to be the place with the most breathtaking snowy landscapes on the continent.\n\nAnd...\n\nIt was the place where my late mother rested.\n\n\"Let's go. Don't just stand there.\"\n\nMy voice was firm, urging the hesitant girls forward.\n\nMy feigned composure felt brittle, riddled with cracks.\n\nRachel and Lucy must have sensed my unease, for they followed silently.\n\nCrunch... Crunch...\n\nThe sound of our footsteps crunching on the snow echoed through the silent woods as we walked among the bare trees.\n\nThen, amidst the pristine landscape, a lone tombstone came into view.\n\nWe approached it in silence.\n\nThe pale gray surface of the stone bore only a few lines of neatly engraved inscription.\n\n[The Most Radiant Flower of the Empire]\n\n-Phillipa Lishite, rests here-\n\n\"...\"\n\nI held my breath, my gaze meeting my mother's for the first time in what felt like an eternity.\n\nHer appearance in my memories had faded, but this was unmistakably her.\n\n-Come here, Raiden.\n\n-Aren't you being a bit clingy these days? You'll be an adult soon...\n\n-Don't worry. Mother will always be by your side.\n\nEchoes of a bygone yesterday whispered in my ears.\n\nI bit my lip, fighting back the wave of emotions threatening to spill over.\n\n\"Young Master, are you alright...?\"\n\n\"...I'm fine.\"\n\nI nodded, my voice steady.\n\nWithout realizing it, I had begun brushing the snow off her tombstone.\n\nThe biting cold sent a shiver through me.\n\n\"Haah...\"\n\nMy breath formed a cloud of white in the frigid air.\n\nMy eyes remained fixed on my mother.\n\nEven in the harsh winter, her resting place exuded a sense of serenity.\n\nA small, awkward smile touched my lips.\n\n\"It's been a while... Mother.\"\n\nMy quiet greeting dissipated into the cold air.\n\nBlinking back the sudden sting in my eyes, I continued.\n\n\"This is the first time I've visited since the funeral... I'm sorry, things have been rather hectic.\"\n\nWell, I suppose things are a little better now.\n\n\"I've decided to stop hurting alone.\"\n\nJust like how I was looking at her now,\n\nwas she also watching over me?\n\nFrom high above, from somewhere beyond this world,\n\nwas she looking down at me, her breath catching in her throat as she witnessed me navigating the path of life?\n\nIf so...\n\n\"It's all thanks to you, Mother. That I'm alive, that I can dream of a future filled with hope...\"\n\nI wished she could hear these meager words of gratitude.\n\nA small tribute to her love, a love that my younger, foolish self had failed to comprehend.\n\n\"Haha... This is the first time I've ever said anything like this. Every time I visited you, all I did was blame you for sacrificing yourself for me.\"\n\nI had blamed her, truly.\n\nBack then, I had cried, believing that it should have been me, not her, who had died that day.\n\nIf only she hadn't saved me.\n\nMore people would have been happy.\n\nFewer people would have been hurt.\n\nEven in this hellish present, she would have been a shining star, illuminating the world with her light.\n\n\"To be honest, I still think that sometimes.\"\n\nRegret was like a pencil mark left on a notepad.\n\nEven after erasing it, realizing the line was out of place,\n\na faint scar always remained.\n\nIt was the same for me.\n\nThe regret that had taken root deep within my heart would continue to torment me for the rest of my life.\n\n\"...But, even so, I'm going to try to live.\"\n\nMy life wasn't just my own.\n\nIt belonged to those who loved me, who worried for me, who found joy in me.\n\nAnd that's why I had no right to treat my life carelessly.\n\n\"Please watch over me, Mother.\"\n\nI'm still clumsy and struggling, but I'll do my best.\n\nThere will be more stumbles and hardships ahead, but I won't falter.\n\nI'll live on.\n\nI'll live tenaciously so that one day I can let go of these foolish regrets.\n\nAnd when the time comes for me to return to your embrace,\n\nI'll be able to run towards you with a clear smile, without a single tear.\n\n\"Thank you... These are the words I've always wanted to say.\"\n\nI made a silent promise in front of my mother, who could no longer reply.\n\nThat I would remember her sacrifice, the sacrifice she made to protect me.\n\nThat I would fight fiercely against the world, with the same intensity as the longing her love had etched into my heart.\n\n- Whoosh...\n\nA gust of winter wind brushed past me, sending a chill across my cheeks.\n\nIt was a biting cold, but I embraced it without resistance.\n\nThis winter's chill was mine alone to bear.\n\nI etched every detail of this moment into my memory.\n\nThe falling snowflakes transformed into musical notes.\n\nThe scent of the season, a gathering of tiny flowers, became a vibrant winter chorus.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"Haa... We're back.\"\n\n\"There's no place like home.\"\n\n\"Brother... My legs hurt...\"\n\n\"Let's rest for a bit... Raiden.\"\n\nBack home after visiting Mother.\n\nWe each let out groans, massaging our stiff legs.\n\nPerhaps it was because it was our first outing in a while,\n\nbut the aftereffects of the journey weighed heavily upon us.\n\nAs I sat on the sofa, soothing my aching muscles,\n\nGilbert approached, a letter in his hand.\n\n\"Young Master... A letter has arrived from the Phyler family.\"\n\n\"...From the Phyler family?\"\n\nI tilted my head at the unexpected name, a sense of unease settling over me.\n\nI accepted the letter, its seal adorned with an elaborate crest and stamp.\n\nThe name 'Raymond Phyler' was inscribed on the front in elegant script.\n\n'Raymond Phyler...'\n\nThe current Duke Phyler, Margaret's father.\n\nHe had personally sent me a letter...?\n\nI stared at the Phyler family crest for a moment before carefully breaking the seal.\n\n*Rip…*\n\nWith a soft tearing sound, a single sheet of paper emerged from the envelope.\n\nThe message within read:\n\n[To Raiden Lishite, Eldest Son of the Lishite Dukedom]\n\n-Greetings.\n\n-It has been quite some time since I last wrote to you.\n\n-The last time we corresponded was regarding the annulment of your engagement with my daughter, approximately two years ago.\n\n-Please forgive my sudden intrusion after such a long silence.\n\n-And please forgive the rather presumptuous request I am about to make.\n\n-To be frank,\n\n-I would like to request your presence at the Phyler estate.\n\n-My daughter's condition has taken a turn for the worse.\n\n-For the past few weeks, she has been suffering from an unknown fever, nightmares, hallucinations, and auditory illusions.\n\n-I have been informed that this matter is somehow related to you.\n\n-Would you be willing to visit and see my daughter?\n\n-I implore you.\n\n[From Raymond Phyler, Head of the Phyler Family]\n\n\"Young Master, this...\"\n\n\"...It seems we need to prepare the carriage.\"\n\nI refolded the letter, placing it back in the envelope, before addressing Gilbert, who stood frozen in place.\n\nAs I rose from the sofa, the texture of the letter lingered on my fingertips.\n\nIt was time to confront a knot that had remained untied for far too long.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

What are you doing here? You called me to your room...\"\n\nI hastily wiped away the remaining traces of tears and turned around, forcing an awkward smile.\n\n\"You came.\"\n\nAriel stood there, dressed in her nightgown.\n\nShe looked at me, standing miserably on the winter terrace, with a puzzled expression.\n\nI shrugged, pretending it was nothing.\n\n\"Just, looking at the stars.\"\n\n\"In this freezing weather? What if you catch a cold? And you're so lightly dressed...\"\n\n\"I appreciate the concern, but I'm not going to keel over from a little fresh air...\"\n\nShe's been treating me like a fragile glass figurine lately.\n\nAs if I hadn't survived a spear through the gut from that monstrous beast.\n\nI chuckled dryly and gestured towards the crimson-haired girl.\n\n\"The stars are beautiful tonight, no clouds. Come here.\"\n\nAriel grumbled something about me being impossible but came and stood beside me.\n\nWe stood side by side, gazing up at the night sky.\n\nThe wind brushed against our faces, playfully ruffling our hair.\n\nEvery now and then, I caught a glimpse of black and red strands dancing in the breeze.\n\nThe scent of another person, faint but present, brought a touch of warmth to the cold night air.\n\nLost in the moment, I felt a poke in my side.\n\n\"Brother.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Have you been crying?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nInstead of answering, I turned to look at her.\n\nHer eyes, a clear, vibrant red, met mine.\n\nThey held a mixture of affection and something akin to longing.\n\nThose red eyes...\n\nMeeting her gaze, so similar to our mother's, I gave her a small smile.\n\n\"Was it that obvious?\"\n\n\"Yes... Your eyes are all red.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nMy stomach churned.\n\nA lump formed in my throat,\n\nAs if someone had shoved a ball of hot dough down my esophagus.\n\n\"Brother, are you alright...?\"\n\n-Raiden, are you okay...?\n\nAriel's image seemed to overlap with a phantom from the past.\n\nCrimson hair.\n\nCrimson eyes.\n\nAnd a voice filled with concern for me.\n\nI realized then how beautifully Ariel had blossomed.\n\nThe sight of my little sister, who had grown into such a lovely young woman, much like our mother, stirred something deep within me.\n\nEven though she had lost her mother and had to endure a childhood with a broken, unreliable older brother.\n\nAriel had bloomed like a resilient rose in a field of thorns.\n\nI was proud of her, and yet, I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt.\n\n\"Brother, why are you so out of it...? Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"No, I'm fine.\"\n\n\"Liar.\"\n\n\"I'm serious.\"\n\nAriel puffed out her cheeks, demanding the truth.\n\nI gently patted her head a few times.\n\nThen, to distract her, I held out something I had been holding in my other hand.\n\n\"Huh...? What's this, Brother?\"\n\n\"Something I've been meaning to show you.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes... I've been putting it off, but I think it's time.\"\n\n\"Is that why you called me to your room tonight?\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\"Hmm... Is it a book? Or a notebook?\"\n\n{Motherly Note}\n\nAriel stared at the notebook in my hand, then flinched.\n\nShe must have seen Mother's name engraved on the cover.\n\nHer red eyes trembled slightly.\n\n\"Brother... This, this is...\"\n\n\"Shh.\"\n\nI silenced Ariel, who was clearly in shock.\n\nShe must have had a million questions, but seeing it would be better than any explanation I could offer.\n\nI quietly flipped open the notebook.\n\nRustle, rustle...\n\nSlowly, I turned each page,\n\nMaking sure Ariel, standing beside me, could see the words written inside.\n\nThe quiet rustling of paper filled the space between us.\n\nAs I reached the middle of the notebook, Ariel began to cry.\n\nShe was biting her lip, trying to hold back her tears, but it seemed like an impossible task.\n\nI continued to turn the pages.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nWith each passing page,\n\nWith each word of our mother's story,\n\nAriel's soft sobs grew louder.\n\nAnd as I listened to her cries, I felt a familiar stinging sensation in my own eyes.\n\nRustle, rustle...\n\nWhen I reached the last page,\n\nI channeled a bit of mana into the paper with trembling hands.\n\nAs always, a familiar voice, preserved within the notebook, reached our ears.\n\n《Static... Crackle...》\n\n《My children... I love you forever.》\n\n《When the world pushes you away and sadness weighs you down, remember this.》\n\n《That Mother is always by your side...》\n\nAt those warm words,\n\nA hot tear traced its way down my cheek.\n\nAs I roughly wiped my wet eyes, trying to swallow the bitter lump in my throat, I saw her looking up at me through my blurred vision.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nOur eyes met.\n\nA maelstrom of emotions, unspoken questions, and lingering grief swirled and intertwined in that shared gaze.\n\nWe stood there, connected by that tangled winter knot.\n\nA heavy silence hung in the air.\n\nIt was Ariel who broke the silence.\n\n\"...It's a diary. Mom's diary.\"\n\nI simply nodded, unable to speak.\n\n\"Where did you find it?\"\n\n\"Mother's study... In the back of the last bookshelf, where the servants rarely went.\"\n\n\"I see...\"\n\nAriel's voice trembled as she fought back another wave of sobs.\n\nI gently reached out and wiped away the tears that had spilled onto her cheeks.\n\nShe leaned into my touch, resting her cheek against my palm.\n\nThe feeling of her tears on my skin made me bite my lip.\n\n\"Brother, when... When did you find this?\"\n\n\"...About a month after Mother passed away.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you show it to me? All this time...\"\n\nHer question hung in the air.\n\nMy heart pounded in my chest like a broken clock's alarm.\n\nI could feel the carefully constructed facade I had built around myself beginning to crack.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nI wished the moonlight wasn't so bright.\n\nI wished the darkness surrounding us was thicker, deeper.\n\nBecause if it wasn't, Ariel would see me crumble, broken and exposed.\n\n\"...I'm sorry, Ariel.\"\n\nThe apology escaped my lips, weak and heavy with unspoken meaning.\n\n\"I was afraid.\"\n\nAfraid that you would hate me.\n\n\"I was afraid that if you saw this diary, you would hate me for surviving in her place...\"\n\nA vile, despicable son who had lived because his mother had died.\n\nI was terrified that you would despise me for it.\n\n\"Everyone seemed to hate me because it was my fault Mother died...\"\n\nI was a coward, blinded by my own grief.\n\nEven as I wished for everyone to turn their backs on me in disgust,\n\nA part of me desperately craved their forgiveness.\n\nA contradictory longing, born from loss and guilt, had consumed me back then.\n\n\"I'm sorry... I'm sorry, Ariel...\"\n\n\"Brother...\"\n\nI clutched at my hair, my body wracked with sobs.\n\nTears streamed down my face, splashing onto the cold stone beneath my feet.\n\nAriel, seeing my despair, threw her arms around me, her own tears flowing freely.\n\n\"It's okay, Brother. It's going to be okay...\"\n\n\"Ugh... I'm sorry, sob... I'm sorry...\"\n\n\"No one hates you, hic... No one. So, we're... We're going to be okay.\"\n\nWe were like wounded animals, comforting each other after losing our mother.\n\nStanding there under the night sky, tending to the wounds that ran too deep for our hands to reach.\n\nWounds that had festered and rotted within our hearts.\n\n\"We're going to be okay. So... Let's stop torturing ourselves, Brother.\"\n\nEven if it meant carrying this burden for the rest of our lives.\n\nEven if the sight of the night sky brought nothing but shame and the whisper of the wind through the trees sounded like a mournful cry.\n\nWe had to live.\n\nWith hearts that sang of stars.\n\nWith a love for all things that were fading away.\n\nWe had to love and cherish each other.\n\nFor the sake of the crimson-haired girl who would be waiting at the end of my path.\n\nI had to live.\n\nI had to face my demons head-on.\n\n\"Let's be strong, Brother.

You're going to visit the Phyler Duchy?\"\n\nThe blue eyes resembling the sea froze coldly.\n\nBeyond her stiff gaze lay negative emotions like shock, sorrow, and rejection.\n\nLucy stared at me, frozen still.\n\nIt was a reaction of utter disbelief.\n\nRegardless, I put down the teacup I was holding on the table and opened my mouth.\n\n\"I received a summons.\"\n\n\"...Are you out of your mind?\"\n\nAt my nonchalant reply, Lucy furrowed her brows.\n\nThe girl's attitude was hostile.\n\nIt was probably due to the antipathy the name 'Phyler' evoked.\n\nAnd it wasn't just her.\n\nAriel, who was sitting next to her, was also silently brooding as if she was uncomfortable.\n\n\"Brother... This isn't right.\"\n\nPerhaps because of the memories of 'that day' when I was driven to the brink.\n\nBoth of them expressed strong opposition to my words about heading to the Phyler Duchy.\n\n\"......\"\n\nRachel alone was keeping silent, but she didn't seem to like it either.\n\nI remained silent.\n\nEveryone reacted exactly as I had expected.\n\nAs I rubbed my mouth at the bitter smile that crept out, Lucy once again tried to dissuade me.\n\n\"Raiden... Have you already forgotten? What Lady Phyler did to you...!!\"\n\n\"Your Highness.\"\n\n\"We almost lost you because of the Lady...!\"\n\nA sudden remark.\n\nIt touched a wound that had yet to heal.\n\n\"After going through something like that... you still want to help the Lady?\"\n\nHer fragile voice was laced with suppressed sorrow.\n\nHer emotions seemed to be intensifying.\n\nAs I gazed at the girl's shoulders, which were trembling more and more faintly, I let out a complicated breath.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't understand their reaction.\n\nBecause others wouldn't know.\n\nThe fact that just as Margaret was a bad person to me, I was also a bad person to her.\n\nWe were always blades aimed at each other's throats.\n\n- I'm tired.\n\n- I want to stop now... I want to stop loving you...\n\nAs if on cue, tearful hallucinations echoed in my ears.\n\nThe scars of the past remained vivid.\n\nWith a pained smile on my face, I muttered as if reminiscing about yesterday.\n\n\"...I also hate her.\"\n\nYes.\n\nI hated Margaret.\n\nWhenever I recalled the memory of that moment when everything almost crumbled, I couldn't resent her enough.\n\nHowever.\n\n\"It must be the same for her.\"\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't understand her.\n\nBecause between us remained an unresolved knot of a terrible ill-fated relationship.\n\nIt was I who started it.\n\nThat's why I had to go see Margaret.\n\nTo put an end to this whole tragedy.\n\n\"Your Highness... Do you know what is more important than remembering the wounds inflicted by others?\"\n\nI asked quietly.\n\nThe blonde girl frowned as if wondering what I was talking about.\n\nI recited the answer without hesitation.\n\n\"It is to remember the wounds you have inflicted on others.\"\n\nThose were the words my mother had repeated to me endlessly when she was alive.\n\nBecause humans are selfish.\n\nThey feel more pain from a paper cut on their fingertip than from someone else's arm being cut off.\n\nTherefore, they obsess over the wounds they received, not the wounds they inflicted.\n\nThe seeds of resentment eat away at affection.\n\nAnd they twist the eyes that were once looking in the same direction.\n\nThe sprouting hatred grows little by little, eventually severing the relationship with a foolish disconnection.\n\n\"She and I... have inflicted too much pain on each other.\"\n\nIt was no exaggeration.\n\nIf Rachel was the one I tormented the most during my wild days.\n\nMargaret was the one who left the cruelest wounds.\n\n\"...That's why I thought we needed to talk. For her sake as well as mine.\"\n\n\"Raiden...\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm not trying to blindly forgive her. Perhaps this step towards the Phyler Duchy will lead to a tomorrow where I sever everything with her.\"\n\nI haven't decided yet.\n\nHow should I treat Margaret in the future?\n\n\"At the very least, I thought we should have a chance to explain our positions to each other.\"\n\nThis was not a decision made on a whim.\n\nEven without that, for the past month, Margaret had been on my mind every single day.\n\nIf Raymond hadn't called for me, I was thinking of sending a letter saying I would visit her first.\n\n\"In the end, I am not being swayed by the situation.\"\n\nI said calmly.\n\nThere were girls glaring at me sullenly, but I didn't cower.\n\nBecause I knew that what melted in those gazes was nothing but worry.\n\nI just gave a faint smile.\n\nI rose from my seat.\n\nAnd then, behind my slowly moving steps, I knelt before my people.\n\nI asked a careful question.\n\n\"...Will you understand me?\"\n\nA gentle ripple spread through the silence.\n\nHis voice, devoid of even a hint of tremor, represented his firm resolve.\n\nThe boy's attitude left those watching him with complicated feelings.\n\nThe children closed their mouths for a moment.\n\nThey soon let out a small sigh.\n\n\"Yes... Who would stop you, Brother.\"\n\n\"If you're saying that much, how can we stop you... It's not like you wouldn't go even if we tried to stop you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Your Highness... Thank you, Ariel.\"\n\nI expressed my sincere gratitude to the two of them who reluctantly gave their permission with sulky replies.\n\nAs I kept my head bowed for a while, Rachel, who had carefully approached me, tapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\"If it's the path the Young Master walks, I will follow you anywhere.\"\n\nThe brown eyes that looked up at me were shining transparently.\n\n\"However... I hope you won't walk on a path of thorns. I hate to see you hurt.\"\n\nThe girl smiled softly, covering her mouth.\n\nI stared blankly at Rachel like that, and then I returned a silly smile.\n\n\"Thank you always.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.\"\n\nShe spoke nonchalantly, but in reality, I was also afraid.\n\nMeeting Margaret was one of the things that most vividly confronted the past I had been trying so hard to escape from.\n\nBut behind me were people.\n\nPeople who would believe in me and support me no matter what.\n\nIn my foolish days, I denied their existence and tried to distance myself, but not now.\n\nThey were the greatest blessing in my life.\n\nThe only affection I was allowed.\n\nKnowing that, the corners of my lips could now form a smile.\n\n\"I'll do my best. For everyone.\"\n\nThe short words evoked the yesterday that had passed.\n\nEngraving the unbroken vow, I rose from my kneeling position.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I truly wish you all the best.\n\nRachel encouraged me until the moment I left.\n\nShe must be anxious.\n\nThe girl didn't show it.\n\nShe just gently pushed my back with her kind hand.\n\nIt was truly blind devotion.\n\nA devotion that I wouldn't be able to repay even if I devoted my entire life to it.\n\n'Would she really stay by my side for the rest of my life...?'\n\nI chewed on my lip at the sudden thought.\n\nRachel had every right to leave me.\n\nIt was a wonder she hadn't run away after all the trouble I had caused her.\n\nI felt a bitter taste in my mouth for no reason.\n\nI turned my gaze out the window to shake off the faintly tinged feelings.\n\n-Rattle... Rattle...\n\nOnly the sound of the wheels turning echoed quietly inside the empty carriage.\n\nLeaving behind the rapidly passing scenery, I gathered my thoughts.\n\n'Margaret.'\n\nIn the letter Raymond sent, Margaret was said to be suffering from high fever, nightmares, hallucinations, and auditory hallucinations.\n\nThis was probably because she had stepped into my mind.\n\nEivy's unique magic, 'Soul Link,' accepts others.\n\nIt shares all the emotions, consciousness, and thoughts that the target possesses.\n\nUntil a few months ago, I was so broken that I couldn't stay sane without the 'Iron Mind.'\n\nIt was only natural that she was suffering, having shared her mind with someone like me.\n\n'The bigger problem is...'\n\nIt was the memories.\n\nThe act of accepting another naturally included the sharing of memories.\n\nSince she had a connection with me from the past, her gaze must have reached even deeper memories.\n\nMargaret must have seen through the truth I had been hiding.\n\nIn other words, it was highly likely that she already knew the whole truth about 'that incident.'\n\n-I can't trust you anymore...\n\n-I'm tired.\n\n-I want to stop now...

      "content": "Three Years of Loss\n\nAnd so, after ten days on the road, the carriage finally arrived at the Phyler Duchy.\n\nThanks to our steady progress, stopping only for brief rests at inns along the way, we arrived five days ahead of schedule.\n\n-Thud…\n\nMy measured steps echoed on the ground as I stood before the grand gates of the ducal manor.\n\nAs expected of one of the Empire’s most prestigious families, the Phyler estate was no less imposing than the Lishite manor.\n\nI observed it with a detached gaze.\n\n‘…It’s been a while.’\n\nHaving visited numerous times in my youth, I felt no particular surprise or awe.\n\nJust a faint flicker of nostalgia.\n\nBefore I had fallen into the depths of debauchery, I had been a frequent visitor to this place.\n\nDrawn by Margaret’s constant stream of letters, eager to see me.\n\nThose were simpler times.\n\nOf course, after the broken engagement, I had never once set foot in this place.\n\nMy memories of this place remained frozen in time, three years in the past.\n\n‘There used to be a cherry blossom tree over there…’\n\nThey must have removed it, finding it didn’t suit the garden’s ambiance.\n\nIt wasn’t the only change.\n\nThe flower garden, once overflowing with forget-me-nots, was now blanketed in winter aconite, swaying gently in the breeze.\n\nSeveral new sculptures adorned the grounds.\n\nJust three years.\n\nIt seemed like an eternity, enough time for a sense of distance to settle between me and this place.\n\n‘It feels… unfamiliar.’\n\nA bitter taste filled my mouth.\n\nThe awkwardness that washed over me was a stark reminder of the three years I had lost.\n\nI clutched at my chest, a dull ache throbbing beneath my ribs.\n\n“…I really came back.”\n\nIt was ironic.\n\nOnly now, standing on the grounds of the Phyler Duchy, did the reality of my return truly sink in.\n\nAs I stood there, lost in thought, a voice broke the silence.\n\n“Duke Lishite.”\n\nTurning my head, I saw the source of the deep voice.\n\nMy gaze was drawn to his striking silver hair, followed by piercing red eyes.\n\nA middle-aged man with the same eye color as Margaret.\n\nThough his physique was somewhat slight, he possessed an undeniable aura of authority.\n\nI immediately recognized him and bowed respectfully.\n\n“It is an honor to meet the Empire’s Shield.”\n\nThe three families that protected the Empire.\n\nThe Sword, the Shield, and the Wings.\n\nThis was Raymond Phyler, current head of the Phyler family, the Shield of the Empire.\n\nThe Duke himself had come to greet me.\n\n“You must be weary from your journey. Was it bearable?”\n\n“It was fine.”\n\n“I am grateful for your prompt response to my summons. I don’t know how to express my gratitude.”\n\nRaymond patted my shoulder as he spoke.\n\nHis voice was devoid of emotion, yet I detected a hint of relief beneath the surface.\n\nHe wasn’t one to express his feelings so openly.\n\nHad he softened in the past three years?\n\nOr was his daughter’s condition weighing heavily on his mind?\n\n“Come, let’s go inside. You must be exhausted from your travels. You should rest.”\n\n“Yes, Your Grace.”\n\nI followed Raymond’s beckoning hand, brushing aside the bittersweet nostalgia that clung to me like a shroud.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, in a room shrouded in darkness…\n\nThe curtains were drawn tightly, shutting out even the faintest ray of sunlight. The only presence in the room was the biting chill of winter.\n\nIn this lifeless space, a young woman lay on the bed.\n\n“…”\n\nSilence, heavy as death, clung to her.\n\nHer silver hair cascaded over the pillow, following the rhythm of her shallow breaths.\n\nHer red eyes were unfocused, vacant.\n\nShe was a shadow of her former self, her vitality fading like cherry blossoms in April.\n\nHer gaze drifted aimlessly as if searching for something that no longer existed.\n\n“My lady.”\n\nA voice called out to her.\n\nIt was her personal maid, entering the room with cautious steps.\n\nApproaching the bed, the maid spoke softly.\n\n“Young Master Lishite has arrived at the manor.”\n\nThe young woman’s shoulders trembled as she flinched at the words.\n\nHer body, which had been so still moments ago, was now wracked with tremors.\n\n“He… He’s really here?”\n\nHer voice was a mere whisper, thick with unshed tears.\n\n“Is it… Is it true…?”\n\n“It’s true, my lady. So please, you must regain your strength. You need to see the Young Master. He came all this way to see you.”\n\nThe maid’s voice cracked with emotion as she dabbed at her teary eyes.\n\nTaking the young woman’s hand in hers, she was met with an icy touch.\n\nThe warmth had long since drained from her, leaving behind only the chill of winter.\n\n“Young Master Lishite will be joining us for dinner in a few hours. You must be present, my lady. He came all this way to see you.”\n\n“To see me…?”\n\nAs if possessed, the girl raised her upper body.\n\nShe reached out to throw off the covers that had been her only solace.\n\n—You are the worst of them all.\n\nThe dormant hallucination resurfaced.\n\nThe words, piercing her heart like a sharp thorn before she could react, stole her breath.\n\nIt felt as if she was choking on blood. She gasped for air.\n\nShe tried to clear her head, but the image only became clearer.\n\n—I can’t… anymore…\n\n—I want to end it all.\n\nEmpty, black eyes stared back at her.\n\nIt was resignation.\n\nThe result of her own obsessive compulsion.\n\nBefore her wavering crimson eyes sat a black-haired boy, devoid of any will to live.\n\n“...How could I possibly…?”\n\nMargaret buried her face in her pillow.\n\n“How could I possibly face him?”\n\n“My lady…”\n\n“Tell Father I won’t be attending dinner.”\n\nShe cut the maid off and dismissed her from the room.\n\nSilence descended once more.\n\nIn that room painted with the color of regret, Margaret pulled the covers over her head.\n\nThe cold seeped in, clutching at her throat.\n\nDrowning in the frigid winter, Margaret closed her eyes.\n\n***\n\nAfter changing into more comfortable clothes in the guest room, I headed straight to see Raymond.\n\nIt was almost dinner time, and we’d agreed to have dinner together.\n\n“Ah, there you are.”\n\n“Welcome, Young Master Lishite.”\n\nThe Duke and Duchess greeted me as I entered the dining room.\n\nI gave a light bow.\n\nAs I took my seat, I quickly scanned the table. Aside from the Duke and Duchess, there was no one else.\n\n‘Margaret… isn’t coming?’\n\nI wanted to speak with her as soon as possible.\n\nDisappointment washed over me.\n\nAs I swallowed my regret, a voice interrupted my thoughts.\n\n“Let’s begin the meal. It’s nothing fancy, but please, eat your fill.”\n\n“Yes, Your Excellency.”\n\nOf course, “nothing fancy” was a lie.\n\nThe vast table was laden with food.\n\nIt was an excessive amount for just the three of us.\n\nMoreover, every dish seemed to be tailored to my taste.\n\nIt was as if the chef remembered my preferences; even the seasoning was perfect.\n\n‘…Why do I keep thinking about the past?’\n\nI couldn’t afford to falter already.\n\nI chuckled wryly to myself, trying to bolster my own weak resolve.\n\n“By the way, Young Master Lishite.”\n\n“Yes, Your Excellency.”\n\n“I heard you achieved remarkable results at the Academy this semester. It seems you’ve finally come to your senses…”\n\nThe dinner continued.\n\nIt was… ordinary.\n\nWe didn’t delve into anything too serious.\n\nAs if they were wary of me, the Duke and Duchess avoided bringing up any sensitive topics.\n\nI didn’t pry either.\n\nI simply gathered information about the current situation from their occasional remarks.\n\n‘So, to summarize…’\n\nThankfully, Margaret was getting better.\n\nAt first, she couldn’t even stomach the sight of food, suffered from insomnia, and acted like a wreck.\n\nBut it seemed she was improving.\n\nShe was eating little by little and managing to sleep.\n\nWhen I received the letter, I was worried that she might be damaged beyond repair.\n\nI was relieved to hear of her progress.\n\nEven if our conversation didn’t go well.\n\nEven if it led to us severing our ties completely.\n\nI didn’t want Margaret to fall apart like that.\n\n‘…It’s getting late. It’s probably best to go see her first thing tomorrow morning.’\n\nMargaret hadn’t appeared at dinner, citing her illness.\n\nBut I wasn’t a fool.\n\nI could tell she was avoiding me out of guilt.\n\nShe probably felt responsible.\n\nWhen I tried to hang myself…\n\nMargaret was one of the children who witnessed that horrific scene up close.\n\nA bitter laugh escaped my lips.\n\nIn the end, I couldn’t shake off my thoughts throughout the entire dinner.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe brilliant sun dipped below the horizon.\n\nAs time passed, even its crimson afterglow faded, leaving only the chill of a winter night.\n\nI stood on the spacious terrace on the second floor of the Dukedom, gazing up at the sky.\n\nA serene coldness brushed against my cheeks.\n\nI stood there for a while, breathing in the scent of the season.\n\n“…It feels like the fatigue is melting away.”\n\nThis had become a recent habit of mine.\n\nStepping out into the night air.\n\nRachel hated it, worrying I’d catch a cold in this weather.\n\nBut I loved this time.\n\nAs I counted the stars in the predawn darkness, I imagined that somewhere among them was a star for my mother.\n\nI searched for her in the dark night sky.\n\nAnd that was why I cherished this time.\n\n“…”\n\nAs I reminisced and savored the quiet anticipation…\n\n“For a young man to enjoy such a melancholy sight… How pathetic.”\n\nA deep voice reached my ears.\n\nI turned to see Raymond walking towards me.\n\nHe stopped beside me.\n\n“I didn’t know Your Excellency enjoyed this terrace as well.”\n\n“I was merely checking in, as you weren’t in your room. You… you haven’t changed a bit in three years.”\n\n“How could my affections change in a mere three years?”\n\nThis terrace held many fond memories.\n\nFrom childhood, it was the place where Margaret and I created countless memories together.\n\nIt was like our own secret hideaway.\n\nEven if those memories were now bittersweet…\n\nThis place held a special place in my heart.\n\n“Much of the mansion has changed… but this terrace remains the same.”\n\n“Of course. That’s how she wanted it.”\n\nBy “she,” he undoubtedly meant Margaret.\n\nWhy did she want this place to remain unchanged?\n\nI didn’t ask.\n\nI just turned my gaze back to the familiar scenery.\n\n“I heard there was a great conflict recently… Steiner sent me a letter.”\n\n“You heard.”\n\n“He said you almost took your own life.”\n\n“…Yes.”\n\n“Was it truly because of her?”\n\n“I cannot say it wasn’t.”\n\nTo be precise, it was a combination of factors that had collided at the worst possible time.\n\nAnd Margaret was undeniably one of them.\n\n“I see…”\n\nRaymond muttered, his expression unreadable.\n\nHe seemed lost in thought for a moment before shaking his head.\n\n“That’s between you and her to resolve… I won’t pry.”\n\n“Thank you for your understanding.”\n\n“You know… I was already aware, but it’s still strange to see you back to your old, brilliant self.”\n\n“I understand.”\n\nEven the servants in my own household still treated me with caution.\n\nIt was only natural for an outsider like him to feel the same.\n\nI shrugged, indicating I wasn’t bothered, and leaned against the terrace railing.\n\nA brief silence followed as the chill of dawn settled around us.\n\nOnce again, it was Raymond who broke the silence.\n\n“Young Master Lishite.”\n\n“Yes, Your Excellency.”\n\n“Do you resent me?”\n\n“How could I possibly?”\n\n“Things… could have been different between you and Margaret.”\n\nThe Duke stared at me, his face an impassive mask.\n\n“If it weren’t for me, perhaps neither of you would have been hurt.”\n\n“Your Excellency…”\n\nI clenched my fists.\n\nMy mouth felt dry.\n\nRaymond was blaming himself for what happened back then, but no matter what anyone said, it was my sin to bear.\n\n“We… we hurt that child terribly.”\n\nIt was an old wound.\n\nTo be precise, it was about the “deal” Raymond and I had made three years ago.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "[T/N: Hey guys. Our team picked up a new novel, I Became the Narrow-Eyed Character in the Little Prince Game from the same author as 'A Depressed Kendo Player Possesses a Bastard Aristocrat'.]\n\nSevered Yesterday\n\nIt was a tale from a distant past.\n\nOr perhaps, it wasn’t that long ago… but it hardly mattered now.\n\nYesterday was gone.\n\nA cruel scar, forever etched and beyond repair.\n\n“Raiden…!”\n\nIt was a day like any other when Margaret clung to me.\n\nA year had already passed since I embraced the role of a wastrel, pushing everyone away after my mother’s passing.\n\nPeople were beginning to leave my side, one by one.\n\nMy father hadn’t shown his face even once since the funeral.\n\nThe nobles I had been close with turned their backs on me.\n\nThe servants, who had been like family, grew colder with each passing day.\n\nEven Lucy and Ariel, who always greeted me with smiles, now seemed to carry a perpetual sadness in their eyes.\n\n‘Perfect.’\n\nEverything was going according to plan.\n\nBack then, I was consumed by the compulsion to be alone.\n\nAs I became increasingly isolated, I felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction.\n\nI had worn them down.\n\nThey were tired of me.\n\nThis chain of events ultimately culminated in the severance of our ties.\n\n“How long are you going to keep this up…!”\n\n“Get lost.”\n\n“Please… This isn’t who you are…”\n\nOf course, not everyone danced to my tune.\n\nThere were always exceptions.\n\nAnd for me, there were two: Rachel and Margaret.\n\nNo matter how cruelly I treated them, they refused to let go.\n\nInstead, as if fueled by sheer stubbornness, they held on even tighter.\n\n“Why have you changed so much…? The you that I loved… you were as warm as a spring flower.”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense.”\n\n“…You promised you’d stay by my side.”\n\n“How long ago was that? Just get lost, you’re in my way.”\n\nMargaret stubbornly refused to give up on me.\n\nPerhaps it was due to the love we shared in happier times.\n\nEven as she witnessed my transformation, she continued to reach out, convinced that she could help.\n\n“I believe…”\n\n“Nonsense.”\n\n“I believe there’s still warmth left in your heart.”\n\nHer red eyes stared at me with unwavering clarity.\n\nI tried my best to shake her off.\n\nAs I walked away, my steps fueled by irritation, I thought to myself:\n\n‘This can’t go on.’\n\nI had to find a way, even a cruel one, to drive Margaret away.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“I heard you were looking for me.”\n\n“Yes, Amelia.”\n\nI had sought out Amelia.\n\nShe had been Margaret’s personal maid since childhood.\n\nHaving grown up in the strict atmosphere of a noble family, Margaret had found solace and companionship in Amelia.\n\nTheir bond ran deep.\n\nI decided to use her.\n\nTo completely sever the tenacious ties that bound me to Margaret.\n\n“I have a proposition.”\n\nI proposed a play.\n\nA messy, scandalous drama.\n\nI intended to show Margaret a scene of her beloved fiancé and her most trusted friend entangled in bed together.\n\nTo break her unwavering spirit once and for all.\n\n“I refuse.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Do you truly not know…?”\n\nAmelia’s brow furrowed as she heard my insane plan.\n\nHer eyes were filled with contempt.\n\n“I would never do anything to harm my lady. Her happiness is my top priority.”\n\n“I’ll give you anything you desire.”\n\n“Ha…! I desire only one thing: for my lady to break free from a monster like you.”\n\nHer words were harsh, but I didn’t rebuke her.\n\nInstead, I smirked, as if I had been expecting this reaction all along.\n\nI knew this would be her response.\n\nWith a serpent’s tongue, I whispered into the girl’s ear, weaving a web of manipulation.\n\n“Yes, that’s it. Our desires align perfectly.”\n\n“…What?”\n\nWhat I desired was a broken engagement.\n\nI wanted Margaret, her spirit crushed, to finally walk away from me.\n\n“I want to be with other women. As for Margaret… well, let’s just say I’ve grown tired of her.”\n\n“You…!”\n\n“Isn’t this the perfect solution? You get to free your precious lady from a monster like me, and I get to rid myself of a nuisance.”\n\nIt was a lie, of course.\n\nThe thought of being with other women, of being tired of Margaret… such base desires had never crossed my mind.\n\nI was merely afraid.\n\nAfraid that Margaret would end up like my mother.\n\nIf she stayed by my side, I feared that she too would be consumed by misfortune.\n\nI didn’t want that.\n\nI wanted Margaret to leave.\n\n‘If I don’t do this, she’ll never give up on me. She’ll cling to me until the very end.’\n\n“…”\n\n“Think about it, Amelia. Surely you don’t want to see the lady you cherish so dearly marry a madman like me and suffer for the rest of her life”\n\nIt was a foolish time.\n\nBut back then, I truly believed that this self-destructive path was the best course of action.\n\nI wasn’t in my right mind.\n\nTrauma and depression had clouded my judgment, making it impossible for me to think straight.\n\n“Make your choice, Amelia.”\n\nAmelia remained silent for a long time.\n\nBut I already knew her answer.\n\nShe cared for Margaret as if she were her own sister.\n\nIn the end, I knew she would do as I asked.\n\n“…Please… don’t forgive me, my lady.”\n\nTears streamed down Amelia’s face as she took my hand.\n\nAnd so, we embarked on a path of irreversible sin.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd so it happened.\n\nAmelia and I put on the perfect show.\n\nJust as Margaret was about to enter her room, we let out a series of suggestive moans.\n\nMaking it seem as if we were… intimate.\n\n“Ah… Young Master Lishite…!”\n\n“Hah… hah… You have such a lovely body, Amelia.”\n\nHer beloved fiancé.\n\nHer most trusted friend.\n\nMargaret was forced to listen to the sounds of the two people she trusted most in the world, their voices twisted into a vulgar display of lust.\n\n“Margaret… That bitch, she’s nothing but a nuisance. She doesn’t even know how to move her hips properly.”\n\n“Ah, please…! You mustn’t… insult my lady…”\n\n“Says the one who’s screwing her lady’s fiancé… on her lady’s bed.”\n\n“Such crude… ah…”\n\nOf course, it was all an act. We hadn’t even touched each other.\n\nBut it was enough.\n\nSoon, we could hear the sound of muffled sobs coming from behind the door.\n\nMargaret stood there for a while, tears streaming down her face, before she finally stumbled away.\n\nThe plan was a success.\n\nToo much of a success.\n\nAs her cries faded into the distance, Amelia and I exchanged grim looks.\n\n“…Get up, Amelia.”\n\nAmelia was silently weeping, her sorrow mirroring Margaret’s.\n\nI forced her to her feet.\n\nThere was no turning back now.\n\nPerhaps there was a way to fix this… but it wasn’t an option we were willing to consider.\n\n“We need to finish this.”\n\nI left the room without another word.\n\nI had to meet with the person who could ensure that this plan reached its conclusion.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

To despise me.\n\nTo forever be trapped in the shadows of ignorance.\n\n“I doubt you’d want your precious daughter to marry a madman like me.”\n\nThis was a transaction.\n\nA mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nI would get her hatred.\n\nAnd he would get to break off the engagement.\n\nOur goals were aligned. A perfectly rational arrangement.\n\n“The choice is yours, Your Excellency.”\n\nI extended my hand.\n\nHis troubled red eyes stared at it silently.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n“…What if I hadn’t taken your hand back then?”\n\nThe winter wind howled around us.\n\nRaymond murmured, his gaze fixed on the darkened world beyond the terrace.\n\nIt seemed the past weighed heavily on his mind.\n\n“It’s my fault.”\n\n“Why do you blame yourself?”\n\nI was the one who had proposed that deal.\n\nI was the one who had inflicted such a deep wound on Margaret.\n\nIn essence, I had held Margaret’s life hostage and forced the Duke’s hand.\n\nRaymond, left with no other choice, had agreed to my terms.\n\n“At least that part… was entirely my fault.”\n\n“You were young. Your mind wasn’t in the right place… while I was a perfectly capable adult.

If I could go back, I would make the same choice.”\n\n“I understand.”\n\nHis response was only natural.\n\nHe was only looking out for his daughter.\n\nHe couldn’t bear the thought of his only child clinging to a madman like me, destined for a life of misery.\n\nI had understood his heart, and that was why I had proposed that deal in the first place.\n\n“It was a choice you made for your daughter.”\n\n“I truly believed it was for her own good back then… but now… I’m not so sure.”\n\nRaymond muttered, his eyes distant.\n\nHe fell silent for a moment, lost in thought, before turning to me.\n\n“This might sound selfish… but I have a request.”\n\n“Yes, Your Excellency.”\n\n“Have pity on Maharet. She’s a child who has already suffered enough.”\n\n“…I’ll try my best.”\n\nI lowered my head, my voice laced with uncertainty.\n\nI didn’t know what the future held for Margaret and me.\n\nSo I couldn’t bring myself to refuse Raymond’s request outright, nor could I accept it wholeheartedly.\n\n“That’s all I ask.”\n\nRaymond nodded at my response and turned to leave.\n\nThe Duke’s figure disappeared into the mansion.\n\nI watched him go for a moment, then shook off the complicated emotions that threatened to engulf me.\n\nHis words echoed in my ears.\n\nI let out a soft sigh.\n\n“Ha…”\n\nOur relationship was a difficult one.\n\nI had hurt Margaret deeply in the past.\n\nAnd Margaret, consumed by the hatred that had taken root in her heart, had hurt me in return.\n\nIn the end, all that remained were scars.\n\nI resented Margaret, yet I also felt an overwhelming sense of guilt.\n\nI was sure she felt the same way.\n\nWe hated each other, yet a part of us still clung to the love we once shared.\n\nIt was a twisted, messy affair.\n\nCould a bond as broken as ours ever truly be repaired?\n\n“Is it even possible… for us to forgive each other… and move on?”\n\nI muttered to myself, then lowered my gaze from the starry sky.\n\nPerhaps the best course of action was to simply ask Margaret herself.\n\n“What do you think, Your Highness?”\n\nI asked softly.\n\nMy words, carried by the night air, reached the far end of the terrace.\n\nA faint rustling sound came from behind the thin curtains as if something was startled by my voice.\n\nA moment later, a trembling hand pulled back the curtain, revealing the figure hidden behind it.\n\n“…Raiden.”\n\nBurning red eyes.\n\nLong, silver hair cascaded down her back.\n\nA slender figure, accentuated by a simple yet elegant dress.\n\n“It’s been a while, Your Highness.”\n\nI greeted Margaret, my voice calm and steady.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

The boy was broken beyond repair.\n\n-Why… Why did you… save me…?\n\n-I… I can’t do this anymore.\n\n-I just want it all to end.\n\nThe boy’s whispered resignation pierced her heart.\n\nThe once pure white fabric of her affection was now stained crimson, riddled with countless cuts.\n\nAnd so, the girl lost her first love.\n\nHer feelings for the boy seemed to solidify, not with affection, but with guilt.\n\nMargaret let out a shaky breath.\n\nA single tear escaped her lips and traced a path down her cheek.\n\n“What have I done…?”\n\nEven though she now knew the truth about the boy’s past…\n\nAll she felt was guilt.\n\nShe should have been furious. Furious that he had deceived her, that he had turned her world upside down.\n\nYet, not a single spark of anger ignited within her.\n\nPerhaps it was because of the lingering affection she held for him.\n\nThe emotions she had tried so hard to bury beneath a mountain of hatred were now resurfacing, demanding to be acknowledged.\n\n“I… What have I…”\n\nThe name of this emotion was love-hate.\n\nOn the surface, it might have seemed like hatred, but…\n\nAt its core, it was love.\n\nUnfortunately, it was true.\n\nShe was still in love with him.\n\nMargaret had realized it far too late.\n\nOnly when things had reached their breaking point did her long-hidden feelings reveal themselves.\n\n“Ha… Ha…”\n\nHer breath hitched in her chest.\n\nIt felt as if she had been plunged into a world devoid of even a single breath of air.\n\nMargaret clutched at her hair.\n\nThe hallucinations intensified with each passing moment.\n\nShe was on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nHer beautiful silver hair was now a tangled mess from her restless hands.\n\n‘…This can’t go on.’\n\nThe girl threw off the blanket that had been cocooning her.\n\nShe got out of bed.\n\nShe felt like she would go insane if she didn't get some fresh air.\n\nHer weak legs hit the floor.\n\nMargaret stumbled towards the door and opened it.\n\n“…”\n\nThe hallway was already shrouded in darkness.\n\nThe girl made her way through it, her steps faltering.\n\nHer destination was the terrace on the second floor of the mansion.\n\nIt was a place she often sought solace in whenever life became too overwhelming.\n\nAnd tonight was no different.\n\n-Whooooosh…\n\nA gust of winter wind greeted her as she stepped onto the terrace.\n\nThe girl gasped for breath.\n\nHer breaths were ragged and uneven, as if she had just barely managed to escape from drowning.\n\n“Ha…”\n\nHer fingers trembled slightly.\n\nMargaret quickly looked away, trying to ignore them.\n\nHer blurry vision settled on the scenery before her.\n\nIt was a nostalgic sight.\n\nThe terrace where she had spent so many happy hours with Raiden during their childhood.\n\nNow, beneath the same night sky that held so many painful memories, the girl bit her lip.\n\nEven the passing season seemed to weep with sorrow.\n\nAs she stood there, lost in her thoughts, a faint voice reached her ears.\n\n-…understand.\n\nMargaret flinched.\n\nShe recognized the voice instantly.\n\nIt seemed she wasn’t alone on the terrace tonight.\n\n-Young Master Lishite.\n\n-Yes, Your Excellency.\n\n-Do you resent me?\n\n-How could you even suggest such a thing?\n\n-Your relationship with Margaret… Couldn’t it have been something more…?\n\nThe girl quickly ducked behind a curtain.\n\nFortunately, it seemed they hadn’t noticed her presence.\n\nShe held her breath.\n\nMargaret remained silent as a mouse, eavesdropping on their conversation.\n\n-Margaret… We’ve hurt that child deeply.\n\nTheir conversation continued.\n\nThey were discussing “that incident” from the past.\n\nIt was a shocking topic, to say the least.\n\nBut Margaret found herself strangely calm as she listened to them.\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nNo, “calm” wasn’t the right word.\n\nThe girl clenched her fists, fighting back tears.\n\nShe wanted to cry, to scream, but the fear of being discovered kept her rooted to the spot.\n\nHearing them speak so openly about their regrets… it only made her feel worse.\n\nHer eyes welled up with tears.\n\n-Have pity on Margaret. She’s a child who has already suffered enough.\n\n-…I’ll try my best.\n\n-That’s all I ask.\n\nBy the time the Duke had finished speaking and left the terrace…\n\nMargaret was on the verge of sobbing.\n\nHer lip, bitten raw, held the same fragile beauty as a frost flower.\n\n-Is it even possible… for us to forgive each other… and move on?\n\nThe boy sighed, his figure silhouetted against the dark sky.\n\nRaiden glanced up at the stars for a moment, then lowered his gaze.\n\n-What do you think, Your Highness?\n\nHis dark eyes were fixed on the curtain.\n\nOr rather, on the girl hiding behind it.\n\nMargaret hesitated for a moment, her heart pounding in her chest, then slowly emerged from behind the curtain.\n\n“…Raiden.”\n\nHer voice was thick with unshed tears.\n\nSadness, fear, guilt…\n\nA torrent of emotions swirled within her.\n\nBut even as she stood there, trembling before him, the boy remained calm.\n\n“It’s been a while, Your Highness.”\n\nIt had been a long time indeed.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Not while she was still hurting.\n\nI waited for the storm of her grief to pass, swallowing down my own bitter emotions.\n\n“Don’t apologize.”\n\n“Raiden…”\n\n“…If anything, I should be the one apologizing.”\n\nMy confession was laced with self-deprecation.\n\n“I’m the one who wrote this miserable play.”\n\n“But… I saw everything… I felt it… The pain you were carrying… the loneliness you kept bottled up inside…”\n\nShe must have been referring to the time our minds had been linked through Eivy’s ‘Soul Link’.\n\nThe emotions I had glimpsed in her eyes…\n\nThey had been a reflection of my own desolate winter.\n\n“When I pushed you away… the sadness you felt… it was so… incredibly vivid… so painful…”\n\nMargaret’s legs buckled beneath her, and she sank to the ground.\n\n“If only I had known… If only I hadn’t left you… You wouldn’t be so… broken…”\n\nShe was blaming herself.\n\nBlaming herself for not seeing my pain, for not being there for me when I needed her most.\n\n…But would it have really made a difference?\n\nThere had been others.\n\nRachel, Ariel, my father, Gilbert…\n\nThere had been candles, offering their warmth, even as I raged against them.\n\nAnd yet, I had still fallen.\n\nI had rejected their light, choosing instead to stumble blindly towards my own destruction.\n\nPerhaps it had been my fate all along.\n\nSo there was no need for her to blame herself.\n\nEven if she had stayed by my side, even if she had never left… I still would have ended up broken.\n\nIt was no one’s fault.\n\nI was the darkness…\n\nAnd they… they were the light.\n\nBut my shadow had simply been too vast, too all-encompassing, for their flickering flames to banish.\n\nI understood now.\n\nVictim, perpetrator…\n\nSuch simplistic labels were meaningless in the face of what had transpired between us.\n\nWe had both been blind, our vision clouded by hurt and resentment, our fingers itching to pull the trigger.\n\nI was tired of it.\n\nIt was time to let go.\n\nTo release the tension in the bowstring, to allow the arrow of blame to fall harmlessly to the ground.\n\nOnly then, I believed…\n\nNo, I hoped…\n\nThat we might find our way back to each other.\n\n‘I’m so tired of hating… and being hated.’\n\nIt was a poison that ate away at the soul, leaving behind only emptiness and despair.\n\nIt stole your warmth, your love, your capacity for happiness.\n\n‘I finally have a second chance… I can’t waste it on something as destructive as hatred.’\n\nLife was too precious, too fleeting, to be wasted on such things.\n\nI had been given a gift.\n\nThe people who cared about me had welcomed me back with open arms, despite everything I had done.\n\nNow, it was my turn to do the same.\n\n“Raiden… I… I…”\n\nMargaret was still sobbing, her words lost in a torrent of grief.\n\nShe remained slumped on the ground, her body racked with tremors.\n\nI offered her my hand.\n\n“It’s cold. Please, get up.”\n\n“…I can’t… You should hate me… You deserve to…”\n\n“Don’t say that.”\n\n“But…”\n\n“Your Highness.”\n\nI cut her off, my voice firm.\n\nAnd then, speaking with a clarity I hadn’t realized I possessed, I said the words that had been trapped inside me for far too long.\n\n“I don’t blame you anymore.”\n\n“…You’re lying.”\n\n“You don’t have to believe me. Not yet. But I’ll stay by your side until you do.”\n\nIt might have been selfish, but there were things I needed to say.\n\n“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for the pain I caused you, for the scars I left on your heart.”\n\n“…”\n\n“I regret everything I said and did to hurt you.”\n\nStanding there, beneath the weight of the winter sky, I asked her a question.\n\n“Will you please… take my hand?”\n\n“Ugh… Sniff…”\n\n“Can I… dare I hope for your forgiveness?”\n\n“Please… Stop looking at me… with those kind eyes…”\n\n“I won’t move from this spot until you take my hand.”\n\n“Hicc… Ugh…”\n\nI knew, of course, that simply holding her hand wouldn’t magically erase the past.\n\nIt would be foolish to hope that things could ever go back to the way they were.\n\nWe were both too broken for that.\n\nPerhaps we were beyond saving.\n\nPerhaps the hate outweighed the love, even now.\n\n“This time… I won’t let go.”\n\nBut even so…\n\nIf she would just reach out and take my hand…\n\nIf she would give me another chance…\n\nI would spend the rest of my life trying to mend the shattered pieces of our past.\n\n“…Why…?”\n\nMargaret looked up at me, her eyes filled with confusion and a flicker of something akin to hope.\n\nFor a moment, she simply stared at me, her expression unreadable.\n\nAnd then, with a fresh wave of tears, she reached out and took my hand.\n\nI pulled her to her feet, and she collapsed against me, her sobs shaking her small frame.\n\n“Raiden…”\n\nHer voice was muffled against my chest, her words barely audible.\n\nI held her close, my hand resting gently on her back.\n\nFor a brief moment, it was almost like old times.\n\n“Ugh… Ah…”\n\nA wave of nostalgia washed over me, and I had to blink back the sudden sting of tears.\n\nI focused on comforting her, pushing aside my own tumultuous emotions.\n\nThe storm of her grief raged on.\n\n***\n\nEventually, her sobs subsided, replaced by the gentle rise and fall of her breath.\n\nShe had fallen asleep in my arms, exhausted from crying.\n\nI carried her back to her room, my steps slow and deliberate.\n\nEach footfall was a silent prayer, a plea for her to find some measure of peace in sleep.\n\n“My lady…!”\n\n“Shh… She’s asleep. Keep your voice down.”\n\nA maid startled us in the hallway, her eyes widening in surprise.\n\nI silenced her with a look, and we continued on our way.\n\nI reached her bedroom and gently laid her down on the bed.\n\nI stood there for a moment, watching as she slept, listening to the soft murmur of her breath.\n\n“…”\n\nOur hands were still clasped together.\n\nI lowered my head and carefully brushed a stray strand of silver hair away from her face.\n\nThe scent of roses…\n\nIt was the same scent that clung to my memories of her, from a time when things had been so much simpler, so much more innocent.\n\nI closed my eyes, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek.\n\nAnd I prayed.\n\nI prayed that for tonight, at least…\n\n“…You would be free from nightmares.”\n\nAnd so, I stayed by her side until dawn.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, Margaret drifted through the depths of her subconscious.\n\nShe was dreaming.\n\nDreaming of a wish she had long held secret, a wish she had tried so hard to deny.\n\n-I don’t blame you anymore.\n\n-Can I… dare I hope for your forgiveness?\n\n-This time… I won’t let go.\n\nIt was a tempting fantasy.\n\nAn irresistible siren song that promised solace and forgiveness.\n\nAnd despite her better judgment, Margaret found herself reaching out, grasping for the hand that was offered to her.\n\nIt was the moment when the nightmare she had been having the night before was shattered.\n\n'How can you be so kind...?'\n\nShe trembled with a heart full of terror.\n\nIt felt like she was using a boy's kindness.\n\nShe couldn't bear the despicable person she had become.\n\nShe realized the truth.\n\nAlthough the boy had lent her his hand, she felt she didn't deserve to lean on his warmth.\n\nShe had already hurt him once with her filthy resentment.\n\nThe girl had to live with a heart that sought eternal atonement.\n\n'Eternally... for your sake alone...'\n\nOf course, it wasn't a normal way of thinking.\n\nBut the girl's mental state was already tainted with guilt, so it was pointless to consider it broken.\n\n'I'll live for you... I'll die for you...'\n\nPerhaps that was the last thing she could offer him.\n\nThe girl wandered, lost in thought, and made the same vow to herself over and over.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

Our chef has outdone himself today in anticipation of your satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Your kindness is appreciated, Your Grace.\"\n\nA Polite conversation flowed between us.\n\nI sat at the dining table, gracefully maneuvering my cutlery.\n\nI had accepted Raymond's invitation to join them for dinner.\n\n\"Is it to your liking?\"\n\n\"It's exquisite.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that.\"\n\nAt first glance, the scene was no different from the first dinner we shared.\n\nExcept for one crucial difference.\n\n\"Lady Margaret.\"\n\n\"Ah... Y-Yes?\"\n\nMargaret was seated beside me.\n\nThe silver-haired girl flinched at the sudden address, her words stumbling out in a rare display of nervousness.\n\nI offered her a small, reassuring smile.\n\nIt seemed she was still adjusting to being outside her room after being confined for so long.\n\n'…Was I being too hasty?'\n\nSeeing her fidgeting, her shoulders hunched as if carrying an invisible weight, a pang of guilt resonated within me.\n\nIt was I who had insisted on bringing Margaret to the dining room.\n\nWorried about her persistent refusal to leave her room, I asked if she would join us for dinner.\n\nAt first, she hesitated, but eventually, unable to refuse my request, she agreed.\n\nShe was still overly conscious of my presence, her every move guarded, her demeanor fragile, as if she might shatter at any moment.\n\nThe sight of her vulnerability sent a wave of bitterness through me.\n\nBut I couldn't leave her to her own devices.\n\nI knew better than anyone that seeking solace in shadows only deepened the wounds of the heart.\n\nHealing required a measured dose of noise, light, and warmth.\n\nI had learned that lesson the hard way.\n\n\"I hear you've been skipping meals lately, Lady Margaret. I'm concerned for your health. Please, eat a little more.\"\n\n\"Ah, I... I'm fine...\"\n\n\"I'm not.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\nMargaret tried to decline, claiming a lack of appetite, but I wasn't letting her off so easily.\n\nThe weaker one felt, the more crucial it was to nourish the body.\n\nI picked up a piece of steak with my fork and offered it to her.\n\nIf she didn't accept it, I was prepared to hand-feed her.\n\nI knew she hadn't eaten anything in two days. I couldn't just sit here and do nothing.\n\n\"Please, eat.\"\n\nMy voice was firm.\n\n\"I'll feed you myself.\"\n\n\"R-Raiden...?!\"\n\nShe was clearly taken aback by my unexpected action.\n\nHer crimson eyes, usually vacant, widened in surprise.\n\nI pressed on, determined to make her eat.\n\n\"Open your mouth.\"\n\n\"W-Wait, just a moment...! This is...!\"\n\n\"I won't touch my own food until you take a bite, Lady Margaret.\"\n\nMy tone left no room for argument.\n\nI had made up my mind.\n\nI had welcomed this delicate flower into my care, and it was my duty to ensure it wouldn't wither away.\n\nI had made a promise.\n\nThis time, I wouldn't let her go.\n\n\"My, my.\"\n\n\"Goodness.\"\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, seated across from us, exchanged amused glances, their eyes twinkling with curiosity.\n\nBut I paid them no heed.\n\nAt that moment, the only thing that mattered was Margaret.\n\nI wished she wouldn't hurt.\n\nI wished she wouldn't cry.\n\nI wished she wouldn't blame herself.\n\nI wished she wouldn't lose her appetite or be plagued by nightmares because of me.\n\nPerhaps it was selfish, but I just wanted her to be happy, just like I had wished when we were children.\n\n\"Please, eat.\"\n\n\"A-Ah... Mm...\"\n\nMargaret's face flushed crimson, her cheeks resembling a blooming rose.\n\nShe hesitated for a moment longer but then, as if touched by my sincerity, she parted her lips tentatively.\n\nI waited patiently.\n\nUntil, finally, her mouth opened fully.\n\n\"Ah... Aah...\"\n\nWith a mortified expression, Margaret accepted the bite.\n\nIt was understandable that she felt embarrassed.\n\nSuch an intimate gesture must have been unfamiliar to her.\n\nYet, she had found the courage to comply.\n\nFor me.\n\nBecause she knew I wouldn't give up.\n\nTouched by her gesture, I instinctively reached out.\n\n\"Good girl.\"\n\nMy hand came to rest on her silver hair, my fingers threading through the silky strands.\n\nDespite her exhaustion, her hair remained soft and smooth.\n\nThe sensation was strangely addictive.\n\nAs I continued to stroke her hair, a soft, breathy sound reached my ears.\n\n\"Ah, uhm...\"\n\nIt was then that I realized my misstep.\n\nMargaret's gaze was fixed on me, her face now not just flushed but practically glowing, her eyes wide with a mixture of confusion and something else I couldn't quite place.\n\n\"...Ah.\"\n\nI had been spending too much time indulging Ariel's need for affection lately.\n\nIt seemed my subconscious had blurred the lines, leading to this unintentional display.\n\nI withdrew my hand, but the damage was done.\n\n\"Uhm, ah...?\"\n\nMargaret was speechless, like a deer caught in headlights.\n\nHer crimson eyes, now shimmering with unshed tears, darted around the room.\n\nI tried to offer words of comfort, but it was too late.\n\n\"I-I apologize, Lady Margaret... That was entirely inappropriate of me...\"\n\n\"H-hic... Sniff...\"\n\nShe began to cry softly, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.\n\nEven amidst her tears, the sight of her diligently chewing the piece of steak I had fed her was endearing.\n\nI stifled a chuckle.\n\nLaughing now would only exacerbate her embarrassment.\n\n\"Excuse me, Lady Margaret.\"\n\nI spent the rest of the meal trying to soothe her while maintaining a semblance of composure.\n\nThe atmosphere around us was far from tranquil.\n\nBut despite the commotion, I felt a sense of ease I hadn't expected.\n\nWhen I first received Raymond's invitation, I had been filled with apprehension.\n\nBut now, having confronted the most agonizing knot in my heart, a sense of calm had settled over me.\n\nThe feeling of walking on a razor's edge had subsided, replaced by a newfound lightness.\n\n'…What about you?'\n\nI wondered if Margaret felt it too.\n\nThis sense of relief, this momentary respite from the weight of our shared past.\n\nI hoped that as she looked around, taking in the sights and sounds of our surroundings, she might find a moment of peace.\n\n'I hope you can heal, too.'\n\nAfter all, she now carried the burden of my pain as well.\n\nIt was my deepest wish that she wouldn't succumb to the darkness that had once threatened to consume me.\n\n'May you find your way back to the light.'\n\nWith that silent prayer, I faced each day, one step at a time.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "***\n\nMy stay at the Phyler estate stretched over several days.\n\nGiven the distance from the Lishite dukedom, we needed at least a week to prepare for the journey back.\n\nFortunately, Raymond was kind enough to extend his hospitality, allowing me to rest and recover without any inconvenience.\n\nNaturally, this meant spending a significant amount of time with Margaret.\n\nNot that I minded, of course.\n\nI cherished every moment by her side.\n\n\"It's been a while since I last stepped foot in this study.\"\n\n\"Indeed...\"\n\n\"Do you remember? We used to have history lessons together here when we were children.\"\n\n\"Of course... I remember.\"\n\n\"I could never quite match your brilliance in academics, Lady Margaret. You always excelled.\"\n\n\"...Please, let's not dwell on childhood memories. It's embarrassing.\"\n\nWe spent our days exploring the familiar halls of the Phyler estate, revisiting places that held remnants of our shared past.\n\nIt was a welcome distraction, a way to fill the silence that threatened to engulf us.\n\nFar better than awkward tea parties, where our hands would hover over our cups, unsure of what to say.\n\nWe moved from room to room, each step a journey down memory lane.\n\nThe study, the dining room, the gardens, the bedrooms…\n\nFinally, we found ourselves on the second-floor terrace.\n\n\"This terrace hasn't changed a bit. It's exactly as I remember it.\"\n\n\"Yes... It's remained the same...\"\n\nI leaned against the railing, feeling the gentle caress of the wind on my face.\n\nMargaret stood beside me, her expression a mixture of melancholy and longing.\n\nIt was here, on this very terrace, that we had spent countless hours together, creating memories that shone brightly in the recesses of our minds.\n\n'…This place must hold a special significance for you as well.'\n\nWhen the manor underwent renovations a year ago, the terrace had been slated for a complete overhaul. However, at Margaret's request, it had been left untouched.\n\nRaymond had mentioned in passing that Margaret would often seek solace on this terrace, spending hours alone under the starlit sky.\n\n'You, too...'\n\nHad she, like me, clung to the remnants of our past, seeking solace in the echoes of what once was?\n\nHad we both, in our own ways, desperately tried to erase each other from our lives while simultaneously clinging to the hope that we wouldn't be forgotten?\n\nThe thought brought a bittersweet smile to my lips.\n\nTo dispel the heavy atmosphere, I forced a lighthearted remark.\n\n\"You always came here when things were tough, didn't you, Lady Margaret? You were quite the crier back then.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Those were the days. Just a few years ago, you would cling to me, sobbing about being scolded by the Duke...\"\n\n\"W-Wait, what are you saying...? Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden...!\"\n\nAs expected, Margaret's cheeks flushed crimson as she stammered out a protest.\n\nI chuckled softly, ignoring her embarrassment.\n\nThe wind whistled gently around us, carrying a hint of warmth that belied the season.\n\nIt was no longer the biting cold of deep winter.\n\nI realized then that winter's reign was coming to an end.\n\nThe calendar read late February.\n\nTime had a way of slipping by unnoticed.\n\nThe season I had believed would last forever was slowly but surely giving way to spring.\n\nThough the chill of winter lingered, hints of life were beginning to emerge.\n\nI took a deep breath, savoring the fresh, invigorating scent that filled the air.\n\n\"The academy will be starting again soon.\"\n\n\"Already...?\"\n\n\"So much has happened in just three short months.\"\n\nYes, so much had happened.\n\nDespair had threatened to consume me.\n\nHatred had taken root in my heart.\n\nFear had paralyzed me.\n\nI had been ready to give up.\n\nBut somehow, I had found the strength to persevere.\n\n- I promise.\n\nI had made a vow.\n\nA vow to never run away again, to face my demons head-on.\n\nAnd so, I had found hope.\n\nI had found love.\n\nI had found strength.\n\nAnd finally, I had found forgiveness.\n\nAll of this, in the span of just three months.\n\n\"There was a time when I cursed everything... But looking back, I realize it was a necessary period of growth, a chance to reclaim what I had lost.\"\n\nThose three months had not been a curse.\n\nI considered them a blessing in disguise.\n\nDespair and hope were but two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe future we create is ultimately our own.\n\nIt was a truth I had learned the hard way, but I was grateful to have learned it nonetheless.\n\n\"I have no regrets.\"\n\nThe pain of the past had subsided.\n\n\"I choose to see it as a passage of time.\"\n\nThose three months were simply a chapter in my life, a chapter that had come to a close.\n\nWhether it had been a curse or a blessing was irrelevant.\n\nTime, after all, marched on.\n\nThe present would soon become the past, just as yesterday had faded into memory.\n\n\"Though I suppose the state of the academy is a concern...\"\n\nI pushed aside the weight of the past, forcing a neutral tone.\n\n\"I heard it was in quite a state after the incident. I wonder if they managed to repair everything during the break.\"\n\n\"You're...\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"It's nothing... Never mind.\"\n\nMargaret seemed about to say something but stopped herself.\n\n\"Lady Margaret?\"\n\n\"It's nothing, really... And I received word last week about the academy. The repairs are complete. Everything is back to normal.\"\n\n\"That's good to hear.\"\n\nWinter was ending, and spring was upon us.\n\nIt was time to return to the academy.\n\nI closed my eyes, feeling the gentle breeze on my face, and smiled softly.\n\n-Ding!\n\nAt that moment, a familiar, mechanical sound pierced the air.\n\nBefore I could react, a bright blue screen materialized before my eyes.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[System has been restored.]\n\nThis was only the beginning.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "I'm home\n\nAnd so, several days passed.\n\nAs I stood for a moment, basking in the warmth of spring, a season I was experiencing for the first time, I realized a week had already gone by since I arrived at the Duke's residence.\n\nThe days had flown by.\n\nFortunately, in that short time, I had managed to mend my strained relationships to some extent.\n\nHowever, a tinge of regret lingered.\n\nIt was time for me to return to the Lishite Dukedom.\n\n\"I'll be on my way now.\"\n\nI bowed politely to Raymon.\n\nStanding before the carriage, seeing me off, Raymon wore an expression of regret.\n\n\"I wish you could stay a little longer.\"\n\n\"The Academy will be starting soon. It's time for me to prepare for the new semester.\"\n\n\"I know... If it were up to me, I'd have you stay with our Margaret. But I know that would be too much to ask.\"\n\n\"Lady Margaret will be fine. She's a strong girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, I certainly hope so.\"\n\nDespite my words, I couldn't help but worry.\n\nMargaret wasn't in her right mind.\n\nGuilt and obsession stemming from me had taken a toll on her mental state.\n\nI'd suggested she stay at the Lishite estate for a while, like Lucy, thinking it might be better for her to be near me.\n\nHowever, she refused repeatedly.\n\nShe wanted to face others, to clear up misunderstandings...\n\n'But she's so adamant... It wouldn't be right to force her.'\n\nPerhaps she needed more time to prepare herself mentally.\n\nWe would meet again at the Academy once spring arrived. It was best not to rush things.\n\nI shook off my swirling thoughts and approached the silver-haired girl, her expression stiff.\n\n\"I shall see you at the Academy, Lady Margaret.\"\n\nA faint smile touched my lips.\n\n\"Until then, please take care.\"\n\nMargaret said nothing, her gaze fixed on me.\n\nHer clear, crimson eyes seemed to reflect the image of a certain black-haired boy.\n\nHer gaze held a quiet intensity as if lost in thought.\n\nI waited patiently for her to speak.\n\nFinally, she parted her lips.\n\n\"...You as well.\"\n\nMay her life be filled with a peaceful light from now on.\n\nHer last words scattered and faded with the gentle breeze.\n\nAs the fragments of consonants and vowels dispersed, I turned away, forcing my feet to move.\n\nStep by step.\n\nI boarded the carriage with measured steps.\n\nMy steps were steady, unwavering.\n\nAs if my heavy legs were light as air, I raised a hand.\n\n\"Farewell, then.\"\n\nLike a spring flower blooming after a long winter, the season of snow transformed into a single seed, drifting away from the Phyler Dukedom.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-Rattle...\n\nInside the carriage, the only sound was the rhythmic clatter of wheels.\n\nI gazed out the window at the rapidly changing scenery.\n\nI wasn't really paying attention to the view. My mind was preoccupied with thoughts.\n\nI tapped my fingers on my sleeve, finding comfort in the repetitive sound.\n\nAfter a while, I let out a deep breath and raised my head.\n\n\"Status window.\"\n\nA single command escaped my lips.\n\nA familiar mechanical sound rang out, followed by a blue screen materializing before my eyes.\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The system has been restored.]\n\nI stared at it silently.\n\n\"......\"\n\nRight, the status window.\n\nI'd been doing my best without it.\n\nDuring the past few months, while the system was dormant, so much had happened.\n\nI'd been so busy that I barely had time to think about it. But now, as my hectic life calmed down, it had returned.\n\n-We told you, didn't we? Someone tampered with your memories.\n\n-Who do you think it was?\n\nI had so many questions about it.\n\nAbout my past life, about this life, I believed to be a possession, and about everything that had led me to this point.\n\nI wanted to desperately ask if it had deceived me.\n\nIf all those words of encouragement and comfort, all those things that had kept me going for the past six months had been nothing but lies.\n\nI wanted to ask... but...\n\n\"How have you been?\"\n\n-Ding!\n\n[The entered question is not valid.]\n\nSomething was wrong with the system.\n\nI'd been trying to talk to it for days, but it wasn't responding properly.\n\nIt was like its consciousness had been emptied out.\n\nNo matter what I asked, all I got were stiff, mechanical responses.\n\nThis wasn't the system I knew.\n\nBefore, it felt like a 'being' with its own personality.\n\nNow, it felt like a lifeless 'machine'.\n\nMaybe it was pretending.\n\nI'd spent a whole day poking and prodding, trying to get a rise out of it, but to no avail.\n\nIt was as hollow as an empty shell.\n\n'......How cowardly.'\n\nHow could it just disappear like this?\n\nI'd hoped for at least an explanation.\n\nI chuckled bitterly, fiddling with the blank blue screen.\n\nWhat had just happened?\n\nTo me, the system had been a friend I could rely on.\n\nWas I so easily disposable to it?\n\nI felt like a discarded toy.\n\n\"I guess I... relied on you quite a bit.\"\n\nI bit my lip, feeling a pang of betrayal.\n\nBut I shook my head, pushing the feeling aside.\n\nTaking a deep breath to compose myself, I turned back to the window.\n\nThe carriage continued on its journey.\n\nSinking deeper into my seat, I muttered wearily,\n\n\"Well... at least the system's back, even if it's different.\"\n\nIt stung that the 'someone' I'd connected with beyond the screen was gone.\n\nBut the system's return was a relief.\n\nIt would undoubtedly prove useful in dealing with the incidents and accidents that would soon plague the Academy.\n\nFor now, life was peaceful.\n\nBut once the semester started, the original story would resume, bringing with it a wave of dangers.\n\n\"...Right, think positive.\"\n\nI emptied my mind and closed my eyes, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over me.\n\nI leaned back against the seat, hoping to catch a little sleep.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

I'm certain this is the right place, according to my memory.\"\n\nAs if searching for something, the boy muttered to himself, constantly scanning his surroundings.\n\nWhile he furrowed his brows and tilted his head in contemplation, a faint figure materialized before him.\n\n\"Who dares to disturb my slumber?\"\n\nA voice laced with chilling bloodlust echoed through the air.\n\nThe emergence of an overwhelmingly powerful presence caused the surrounding mana to tremble faintly.\n\nThe sheer pressure emanating from the figure distorted the very fabric of space around it.\n\nThe shadowy figure spoke, gazing down at the boy standing before it.\n\n\"To trespass upon my domain with such audacity... You shall pay for your arrogance with your life.\"\n\n\"Aren't you being a little too uptight?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"We're both of the Dragon Clan, let's help each other out. If we remain so closed off, all we'll hear are whispers about snakes~!\"\n\n\"What... are you talking about?\"\n\nThe figure seemed momentarily taken aback, its expression unreadable.\n\nThe boy, staring at the shimmering heat haze, let out a knowing chuckle.\n\n\"Found you at last. The leader of the Red Dragons... Plagueis.\"\n\n\"How do you know that name...?\"\n\nPlagueis, concealed within the shadows, frowned in bewilderment.\n\nHe had employed Recognition Reduction Magic so potent that it could deceive the very laws of the world.\n\nNo ordinary being should have been able to perceive him.\n\nYet, this boy saw through the Polymorph, instantly discerning his true identity.\n\n\"You're not human.\"\n\n\"Bingo~!\"\n\n\"Then what are you...? A Goblin? An Archangel? Or perhaps... a demon?\"\n\n\"I told you, I'm a Dragon.\"\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous!

What are you?\"\n\n\"Now that hurts~ I haven't forgotten you, but you've gone and forgotten me...!\"\n\nThe boy dramatically scratched his head, feigning offense.\n\nHe sighed and bit his lip in thought for a moment before slapping his forehead as if struck by a sudden realization.\n\n\"Aha~! You don't recognize me because I'm in this form, right?\"\n\n\"What...?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sorry... Just wait a second. I'll return to my original form.\"\n\nThe boy waved his hand dismissively, urging patience.\n\nHe bowed his head and muttered something in an unknown tongue, then raised his hands high above his head and clapped them together with a resounding snap.\n\n-Snap!\n\nHis thumb and middle finger collided, producing a sharp sound.\n\nThe sound wave, born from the somewhat theatrical gesture, sliced through the silence of the forest and shot outwards.\n\nSimultaneously, the boy's demeanor underwent a drastic transformation.\n\n\"How about this... Recognize me now?\"\n\nHis brilliant blond hair shifted, turning as white as snow.\n\nHis eyes blazed with an intense blue light.\n\nTiny blue sparks crackled around his fingertips.\n\nThe boy's appearance had transformed in an instant, and Plagueis, who had remained composed until now, stiffened in shock.\n\n\"...Impossible.\"\n\n\"See? You recognize me now.\"\n\n\"H-How... How can a Thunder Dragon still be alive? Your Clan was wiped out over 200 years ago...!\"\n\nA remnant of the past, appearing so abruptly.\n\nPlagueis stammered, unable to conceal his astonishment.\n\nThe white-haired boy simply stared at him, as if observing his reaction.\n\nHis playful smile had vanished.\n\nAll that remained on his face was a chilling gaze, devoid of any warmth.\n\nHis voice, as cold as winter, declared,\n\n\"I've come for retribution, Plagueis.\"\n\n\"R-Retribution, what are you...\"\n\n\"When our Clan was hunted. When we begged for your help, you turned your back on us and scurried away like a rat. This is the price for that betrayal.\"\n\n-Crackle!!\n\nAzure lightning bolts erupted around the boy, crackling with ferocious energy.\n\nHis white hair whipped around him in the turbulent air.\n\nThe boy brushed his bangs aside, a dangerous glint in his eyes.\n\n\"Thanks to you lot... I've experienced some truly delightful things.\"\n\n\"W-Wait...!!\"\n\n\"The screams of my mother, begging me to run while I still could... They still ring clear in my ears.\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd! How can you blame us?! It was the humans who hunted the Dragons!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right... I knew you'd try to weasel your way out of it.\"\n\nHatred flickered within his crystalline pupils.\n\nPlagueis, feeling an oppressive weight crushing down on him, cried out,\n\n\"Stop spouting nonsense! Back then, we...\"\n\n\"You made a deal with the humans, didn't you? In exchange for revealing the location of our Clan, you secured your own safety.\"\n\n\"H-How could you possibly know that...?\"\n\n\"Because I heard it directly from the mouths of your brethren.\"\n\n\"Our brethren? All those who knew of that agreement are dead...!\"\n\nPlagueis's voice trailed off, his face contorting in horror as a chilling realization dawned upon him.\n\n\"Don't tell me... for the past 200 years, the one who has been hunting down the Lord-level Dragons...\"\n\n\"That's right, it was me.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I've killed the Green, the Blue, the Black, even the Gold... Now it's your turn.\"\n\nThe boy's casual confirmation sent a shiver down Plagueis's spine.\n\nFor a moment, Plagueis stood there, frozen in terror.\n\nThen, his eyes blazed with crimson fury as he roared,\n\n\"How dare you utter the word 'death' in my presence! I am the pinnacle of all Dragons!!\"\n\n\"Whatever you say.\"\n\n\"You may be a Thunder Dragon, but you're still just a child, barely 300 years old! You are no match for me!!\"\n\n-Crack, boom!\n\nWith a sickening crunch of bone and flesh, Plagueis's body began to transform.\n\nThe shimmering heat haze dissipated, and his form swelled in size.\n\nCrimson wings sprouted from his back, and a massive tail lashed behind him.\n\nPlagueis, having shed his Polymorph, stood revealed as a colossal Fire Dragon, radiating overwhelming power.\n\n\"I'll tear you limb from limb!!\"\n\nBathed in the eerie glow of his crimson aura, Plagueis opened his jaws wide.\n\nIntense heat gathered within, forming a swirling vortex of ethereal flames.\n\nThe sight was enough to steal the breath of any onlooker, yet the boy merely smirked.\n\n\"What a load of crap. You pathetic excuse for a Dragon.\"\n\nThe boy's hand shot up towards the sky once more.\n\nCrackling, buzzing noises filled the air as azure lightning crackled around him, painting the atmosphere with its electric fury.\n\n\"The Book of Sacrifice.\"\n\nOh, Primordial Thunder Dragon.\n\nYour descendant calls upon your might.\n\nTake this fleeting future, and grant me power in the present.\n\nNine hundred years of my life, I offer.\n\nGrant me your divine power.\n\n\"Pierce through.\"\n\n-Zernoth Style Forbidden Magic, Third Verse of Paradox-\n\n-Assassination-\n\n-Boooom!!!\n\nAs the incantation left his lips, a blinding blue light engulfed the boy, expanding outwards to encompass the entire forest.\n\nHe clenched his fist, feeling the raw power of the electric current coursing through his veins.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, he launched his fist forward, aiming for the heart of his enemy.\n\n-Thud...\n\nA dull thud echoed through the air as Plagueis, who had been preparing his fiery breath, was struck.\n\nOr rather, it wasn't quite a hole.\n\nThe majority of Plagueis's body, except for his long Dragon neck and tail, had simply vanished.\n\n-Thump, thud...\n\nMoments ago, he had been a magnificent beast, brimming with life. Now, he was nothing more than scattered chunks of flesh.\n\nWhat little remained of his body crashed to the ground with a sickening thud.\n\nAs crimson blood pooled on the forest floor, the boy casually wiped his hand on his clothes.\n\n\"Ugh... This is exhausting.\"\n\nHe stepped onto Plagueis's severed head, his face etched with fatigue.\n\nHe had sacrificed a significant portion of his lifespan for this power, and the strain was evident in the blood trickling from the corner of his lips.\n\nAs he wiped the blood from his mouth, a raspy voice reached him from below.\n\n\"With a single... blow... How is this... possible...\"\n\n\"What? You're still alive?\"\n\nEven with his body gone and only his head remaining, Plagueis clung desperately to life.\n\nThe boy frowned at the Fire Dragon's tenacious grip on existence.\n\n\"Even for a Thunder Dragon... such power... is unheard of...\"\n\n\"Just die already. My lifespan aches from overusing my powers.\"\n\n\"Who... are you...?\"\n\nWith his dying breath, Plagueis gasped out one final question.\n\nThe white-haired boy spat out a mouthful of bloody saliva.\n\n\"Ugh, just die quietly. Stop asking pointless questions.\"\n\n\"Damn you...\"\n\n\"...Fine, since you're about to kick the bucket anyway. I'll answer that much.\"\n\nListen well.\n\nThis is both revenge for the blood spilled in the past.\n\nAnd a promise of the endless suffering your Clan will face from now on.\n\n\"My name is Zernoth.\"\n\nThe last of the Thunder Dragon Clan.\n\nThe Empire's hidden shame, a living testament to a history they tried to erase.\n\nAnd...\n\n\"Your reckoning.\"\n\n-Crack!!\n\nZernoth's fist shot out once more, crushing Plagueis's skull with a sickening crunch.\n\nThe once-mighty Dragon's head was now nothing more than a pulpy mess.\n\nZernoth stumbled back, collapsing to his knees with a groan.\n\nThe metallic scent of blood filled his nostrils.\n\nHe lay there for a moment, catching his breath, before looking up at the sky.\n\n\"...I miss you, Mom.\"\n\nA single sentence escaped his lips, filled with longing and a profound sense of emptiness.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

The future of House Lishite is bleak indeed.\n\nStaggering footsteps crossed the heart of the Academy Plaza.\n\nAs Raiden wandered, reeking of alcohol, the other students scurried out of his path.\n\nThey had no wish to experience whatever torment awaited those who caught his eye.\n\nWith gazes mixed with contempt and fear, they watched him from afar.\n\n\"......\"\n\nRaiden, too, was aware of their stares.\n\nHowever, he showed no reaction.\n\nNormally, he would have picked a fight with a few of them, just to further tarnish his own reputation.\n\nBut today, he simply wasn't in the mood.\n\nOr rather, it wasn't a matter of mood, but of his heart.\n\nHe was utterly exhausted.\n\n- To think, the first thing you do after returning to your family home is flip the table during dinner.\n\n- You haven't changed one bit, Raiden.\n\n- Just how far do you intend to disappoint your father?\n\nThe words he heard from his father yesterday echoed in his ears.\n\nDisappointment.\n\nAs he ruminated on the weight of that simple word, a girl's voice resonated in his mind.\n\n- Young Master, please stop this.\n\n- There's no need to intentionally invite their scorn...\n\n- It wasn't your fault that the Duchess passed away. So please...!\n\nThe voice of someone who worried for him.\n\nA few sentences, laced with a delicate tremor.\n\nAnd then...\n\n-Slap!\n\n-Silence, Rachel.\n\nThe sharp sound of flesh against flesh, cutting her words short.\n\nA red handprint bloomed on the girl's cheek.\n\nHis reason consumed by the mention of his mother, the boy lashed out.\n\n- How dare a mere servant speak so boldly.\n\n- You seem to be mistaken about your place just because I indulged you a little as a child...\n\n- Don't you dare speak to me, you gutter trash from the slums.\n\n- If I hadn't taken you in, you'd be whoring yourself out in some brothel by now.\n\nTears welled up in her brown eyes.\n\nYet, her gaze remained fixed on the boy.\n\nHer face, etched with sadness and pity, was almost unbearable to look at.\n\nThe utter lack of hatred or resentment in her pure compassion only intensified the ache in his heart.\n\nRaiden, feeling a wave of nausea rising within him, fled the mansion.\n\nAnd now, back to the present.\n\n\"Ugh... Haa...\"\n\nRaiden groaned, trying to calm his churning stomach, still rebelling from the excessive alcohol.\n\nHe usually only drank enough to maintain his delinquent act.\n\nBut yesterday's events had driven him to drink beyond his usual limit.\n\nDragging his foggy mind, he started towards the carriage stop, hoping to catch a ride back to the dormitory.\n\nIt was then that...\n\n-......\n\n-......\n\nRaiden noticed a sudden hush falling over his surroundings.\n\nHe slowly lifted his gaze to see Margaret and her entourage approaching from a distance.\n\nThe Academy students, who were gossiping about him just moments ago, sealed their lips, falling into an uneasy silence.\n\nIt was only natural.\n\nMargaret loathed it when whispers about Raiden reached her ears.\n\nThe reason why even the gossip-hungry social circles avoided mentioning the delinquent Raiden was...\n\nBecause she, and her family's influence, suppressed it.\n\nIt was the only sensitive topic for Margaret, the Empire's most revered flower.\n\nA few months ago, some of her followers, eager to curry favor, dared to badmouth Raiden in her presence. They were promptly ostracized from social circles, a tale that spread like wildfire.\n\nThis incident fueled rumors that Margaret still harbored feelings for Raiden.\n\nShe, however, vehemently denied it, stating that she simply couldn't bear to hear even a whisper about him.\n\nWhatever the reason, it was an unspoken rule within the Academy...\n\nSpeaking ill of Raiden, at least within earshot of Margaret, was strictly forbidden.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nRaiden turned to leave at the sight of Margaret approaching.\n\nHowever, his alcohol-laden body refused to cooperate.\n\nAs he cursed his own sluggishness, Margaret and her group stopped right in front of him.\n\n\"Hahaha! Is that true, Your Highness?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought I was going to die. And then, my father... Oh.\"\n\nMargaret, who was engaged in a lively conversation with her entourage, stopped mid-sentence as she noticed Raiden.\n\nFor a moment.\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\nHis, black and clouded with exhaustion.\n\nHers, red and shimmering with a hint of confusion.\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nA beat of silence passed.\n\nIt was Raiden who looked away first.\n\nHe let out a tired sigh and continued on his way.\n\nAs the boy brushed past her, Margaret noticed something.\n\nA shadow of loss and emptiness had settled upon his face.\n\nShe sensed something amiss.\n\nHaving secretly observed him all this time, despite her feigned indifference, she could tell that something was different about him today.\n\nHis eyes, usually brimming with arrogance and annoyance, were…\n\nDowncast, like a trampled flower lying on the pavement.\n\nConcerned, Margaret found herself calling out to him before she could stop herself.\n\n\"Hey...! You!\"\n\n\"......?\"\n\nRaiden turned slightly at the sound of her voice, his expression questioning, as if surprised that she would address him directly.\n\nMargaret, realizing the impulsiveness of her actions, froze.\n\nEven if her emotions had gotten the better of her...\n\nTo think she had grabbed his sleeve.\n\nHer face stiffened, and her lips trembled slightly.\n\nRaiden, noticing her reaction, frowned.\n\n\"...What is it? If you have nothing to say, I'll be on my way.\"\n\nHe roughly shook off her hand and turned to leave again.\n\nHowever, his movement was quickly halted.\n\nThis time, it was Margaret who had grabbed his hand.\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"Haa... I asked you what you wanted. Are you deaf?\"\n\nMargaret seemed momentarily angered by his response, but she quickly suppressed it.\n\nHis face, seen up close after so long, seemed…\n\nSo very fragile.\n\n\"How rude. Even if we're both from Ducial families, there's a clear difference in our standing... How dare the Empire's Shield obstruct the path of the Empire's Sword?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"And I believe I told you I didn't want to see your face again. Are you deaf as well as blind? You truly are an idiot...\"\n\nTo the boy spewing harsh words, no different from any other day, Margaret asked in a small voice.\n\n\"...Are you alright?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nRaiden's words caught in his throat.\n\nThe boy's eyes, which had been downcast since yesterday, shook violently.\n\nA throbbing pain shot through his head, sending a jolt of agony through his body.\n\nHe clenched his jaw, trying to suppress the turmoil within him, but his composure was crumbling.\n\nAre you alright?\n\nIt was a simple question.\n\nA question he could have easily brushed aside with a sneer, as he always did.\n\nYet, for some reason...\n\nHe found himself struggling to bear the weight of those words.\n\nHis heart pounded in his chest, and his thoughts scattered.\n\nUnable to utter a response, Raiden turned away.\n\nHe roughly shook off Margaret's hand and muttered a single sentence.\n\n\"Don't worry about it...\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nWith that, Raiden headed towards the carriage stop.\n\nMargaret stood there, watching the boy's retreating figure.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

That's the spirit!\n\nAlcohol is like magic.\n\nIt brings back vivid memories that I thought I had forgotten.\n\nAnd it paints the stories I hold dear in even more nostalgic hues.\n\nI loved this feeling.\n\nDespite all the misfortune I've endured.\n\nMy past wasn't all bad.\n\nI cherished these moments, reminiscing about the people I loved.\n\nAnd as time passed, I was reminded of how important love is to me.\n\nIt allowed me to nurture even deeper affection for those around me.\n\n\"Ariel, want to try some? You've never even had a sip.\"\n\n\"Hmph, no thanks. I'm good with my lemonade.\"\n\nThe red-haired girl glanced at the glass in my hand for a moment.\n\nThen, she let out a snort and turned her head away.\n\nUh oh, I think I might have upset her.\n\nDid I say too much?\n\n\"Do you hate it that much when I drink?\"\n\n\"Yes! You smell like alcohol!\"\n\nOh my, our Ariel is at the age where she says such heartbreaking things...\n\nI looked at her with slightly hurt eyes.\n\nMy gaze held the melancholy of an older brother watching his little sister go through puberty.\n\nWell, it's a little unfair.\n\nDrinking isn't just about having fun.\n\nWhen I'm drunk and lying in bed, I can fall asleep instantly without any dark thoughts.\n\nIt's a kind of sleep therapy I prescribe to myself... but I don't need to go into that.\n\nI don't want to spoil the mood.\n\nI pushed those thoughts aside and sat closer to Ariel.\n\n\"Alright, alright. I'll cut back on the drinking.\"\n\n\"...Really?\"\n\nAs I said that, stroking her hair, she glanced at me with a pout.\n\n...How can someone be so adorable?\n\nI swear, Ariel must be a different species altogether.\n\n\"Promise me! Pinky promise!\"\n\n\"Pfft, ahaha... O-okay, okay! I promise! Pinky promise!\"\n\nShe puffed out her cheeks and held out her pinky finger. I couldn't help but laugh.\n\nShe's so precious.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the girl in front of me.\n\nIt was a sentiment that extended to everything around us.\n\nThe cozy atmosphere, the laughter of my loved ones.\n\nBeyond the hazy scenery, the lingering scent of colorful paints tickled my nose.\n\n\"Hey! Why are you laughing?! Are you making fun of me?!\"\n\n\"Ariel, you really haven't changed a bit since we first met. That's why I love you.\"\n\n\"Even Your Highness is teasing me now...?!\"\n\nPerhaps it was a representation of the emotions I had long forgotten.\n\nA loving kiss that gently erases the present contradiction of smiles and tears.\n\nUnable to contain my overflowing heart, I spread my arms wide and pulled the two girls in front of me into a warm embrace.\n\n\"Wah...!?\"\n\n\"Raiden?!\"\n\n\"Young Master...?\"\n\nThe two seemed startled for a moment before relaxing into my arms with a familiar sigh.\n\nTheir warmth seeped into my chest.\n\nA gentle smile spread across my lips without me realizing it.\n\n\"Don't you think you've been a bit too huggy lately?\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah! You've been hugging everyone you see!\"\n\n\"I-I like it... but sometimes it's a bit... sudden...?\"\n\nWell, it's not like I hug that many people.\n\nJust Father, Gilbert, Ariel, Lucy, and Rachel...\n\nOkay, maybe it is a bit much.\n\nBut what can I say?\n\nIt feels so good.\n\nTo hold you all, the people I love most.\n\nI just want to let you know how much I love you.\n\nI don't know how else to express it.\n\nI want to feel your warmth a little longer.\n\nI want to savor the feeling of my old emptiness being filled by you.\n\n\"So, you don't like it?\"\n\n\"...It's not that I don't like it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say I hated it!\"\n\n\"I-I like it too...!!\"\n\nYes, right now.\n\nI just want to etch the beating of my overflowing heart into my memory.\n\nSo that even when time passes, and this warmth fades,\n\nAnd the night returns to my world, filled with compulsion and loneliness,\n\nI can recall this moment and find comfort in the memory.\n\nI want it to leave an unerasable mark on my heart, like the hands of a clock frozen in time.\n\n\"Let's all have a toast, shall we?\"\n\n\"...You know what's weird about you lately, brother? It's like you're trying too hard to be cheerful.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. Everyone, raise your glasses! High in the air!\"\n\n\"Haha, how about a kiddie cocktail for our little missy?\"\n\n\"Oh, come on! Even you, old man...?!\"\n\nCheers erupted amidst the lively atmosphere.\n\nWe emptied our glasses, celebrating this joyous day.\n\nI hid the loss and emptiness of my past deep within my heart, plastering a cheerful smile on my face.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nI'm okay.\n\nI have to be okay, so I will be.\n\nLet's just empty our glasses.\n\nSo that I can promise you all a brighter future.\n\n\"Ahahahaha!!\"\n\n\"Eeeeek! You're all too much!\"\n\nLet's make a pinky promise.\n\nAnd whisper in each other's ears:\n\nPromise me we'll see each other again.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "Hiatus Notice: Updates will continue once the author returns.The Start of a New Semester\n\nThe long, long winter break had finally come to an end.\n\nIt felt like the start of the new semester would never come.\n\nTime had flown by without me even realizing it.\n\n\"......So much has happened.\"\n\nIt had been an eventful two months.\n\nI doubt there was a single student who had a more eventful break than me.\n\nA soft smile graced my lips.\n\nIt was a strange feeling.\n\nJust a few days ago, I hadn't given much thought to the end of the break.\n\nBut now that the day had come to leave for the Academy, I felt a twinge of regret.\n\nA quiet thought crossed my mind.\n\n\"It would've been nice if I had... a little more time.\"\n\nIf only the break had been a little longer, maybe I could have done more.\n\nIt was only recently that I had finally untangled the knots in my life.\n\nPerhaps I could have even enjoyed a truly relaxing vacation.\n\n-Heehee! I'll show you what a real snowball fight is, brother!\n\n-H-hey, wait a minute... Isn't using ice magic cheating?\n\nHaving a snowball fight with Ariel, bundled up in her winter hat.\n\n-It's been so long since we've had such a peaceful tea time... I really do feel most at ease by Raiden's side.\n\n-As do I, Your Highness.\n\nEnjoying tea time with Lucy in the garden, surrounded by blooming winter roses.\n\n-Your drinking seems to have improved. But don't overdo it, too much alcohol isn't good for you.\n\n-Heh... You're one to talk, Father.\n\nSharing a drink with Father late at night.\n\n-Apples are not round at all... That's because they crunch when you bite into them.\n\n-......Oh my.\n\nExchanging silly jokes with Gilbert and his otherworldly sense of humor.\n\n-Is it alright for me to stay by your side like this...? I feel like I'm taking up too much of your time.\n\n-I have plenty of time for you, Lady Margaret. Please don't worry.\n\nTaking care of Margaret, who was still not fully recovered.\n\n-Young Master, you shouldn't sleep on the sofa like this.\n\n-I'm just so drowsy... Just let me lean on you for a bit.\n\n-...Just for a bit, okay?\n\nSitting side-by-side in front of the warm fireplace, basking in the comfort of each other's presence.\n\nJust picturing these scenes brought a smile to my face.\n\nAnd that's why I felt a tinge of sadness.\n\nBut it was alright.\n\nThere was always a next time.\n\nI had promised not to run away or disappear anymore, so there was plenty of time.\n\nThere was no need to rush.\n\n\"Next winter break... maybe we can all go on a trip to the beach house.\"\n\nI muttered to myself, a smile playing on my lips.\n\nAs I calmly painted a picture of the future, a familiar voice calling my name reached my ears.\n\n\"Young Master? It's time to go.\"\n\nIt was Rachel.\n\nI nodded silently and started walking.\n\nThe carriage was waiting for us.\n\nIt seemed that Lucy and Ariel were already on board.\n\nUrged on by Rachel, I stepped into the carriage.\n\n\"We'll be back soon, Father.\"\n\n\"Take care.\"\n\nA brief exchange between father and son amidst the bustle.\n\nAfter making eye contact with the rest of the staff, I boarded the carriage.\n\n-Neigh!\n\nThe carriage started moving immediately.\n\nAs the horses picked up speed, I watched the mansion grow smaller and smaller in the distance.\n\nI pushed down the lingering anxiety in my chest.\n\nThe feeling of melancholy soon blossomed into a flower of fondness.\n\nI didn't look back.\n\nAfter all, this was a home I would always return to.\n\nNow was the time to move forward, towards a new chapter.\n\n***\n\n\"We've arrived.\"\n\nThe carriage came to a gentle stop, and the coachman's voice announced our arrival.\n\nWe stepped out of the carriage.\n\nThe Academy building came into view.\n\nIt was as grand as any city, yet not overly crowded. As magnificent as the Duke's mansion, yet not overly ornate.\n\nIt was a truly impressive sight.\n\nA sense of familiarity washed over me as I started walking.\n\n\"...It's been a while.\"\n\nIt had only been two months since I was last here.\n\nYet it felt like I was returning after years of being away.\n\nAs I walked slowly, letting the winter breeze wash over me, a memory from the past echoed in my ears.\n\n-Oh my! Young Master...! Look outside! It's huge!!\n\n-Yes, yes, I know, now please sit down. What if you get hurt?\n\n-I'm fine! I always practice my balance so that I can be the perfect attendant...! Huh?!\n\nThe day I first stepped foot in the Academy, guided by my status window.\n\nDespite trembling with anxiety and worry, the memory of that moment, filled with hope and determination for happiness, was vivid.\n\nHad it really been half a year already?\n\nI let out a breath, realizing how quickly time had flown by.\n\nI wasn't the only one feeling a strange sense of nostalgia.\n\nThe others, walking alongside me, seemed to be having similar reactions.\n\n\"You're right, it has been a while.\"\n\n\"It feels weird, brother... I hated the thought of school starting again, but now that I'm here, it doesn't seem so bad.\"\n\n\"They've repaired everything so well, haven't they? I'm sure it was a mess when we left for break... The Academy's ability to recover is amazing.\"\n\nWe walked on, quietly observing our surroundings.\n\nThe Academy looked as good as new, as if the invasion three months ago had never happened.\n\nIn fact, it seemed even more pristine than before.\n\nAs I was lost in thought, admiring the scenery, a familiar voice called out from behind.\n\n\"Well, well, well! Look who it is!\"\n\nA friendly yet annoyingly flippant tone.\n\nI recognized who it was immediately and turned around, his name already on my lips.\n\n\"Golden Boy...?\"\n\n\"Long time no see, Maniac!\"\n\nGolden Boy waved casually.\n\nThe blond boy sauntered towards us with his usual swagger.\n\nIt seemed he had also returned to the Academy for the start of the semester.\n\nWe had just happened to run into each other.\n\nSeeing his face after so long...\n\nI stared at his signature blue eyes for a moment before clicking my tongue.\n\n\"......This is bad.\"\n\n\"Hey! What's with that blatant reaction?! Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nuisance!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"That hurts! It's been ages! The least you could do is greet me properly!\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say to you.\"\n\n\"Argh!!!\"\n\nThe blond, tanned idiot threw a tantrum.\n\nI couldn't help but smirk at his childish behavior.\n\n\"......Hmm?\"\n\n\"What is it now?\"\n\n\"No, it's just... you seem different. Your complexion looks a bit brighter.\"\n\n\"Does it?\"\n\nI tilted my head and touched my face, but it didn't feel any different than usual.\n\nI couldn't tell.\n\nWell, it didn't matter. It wasn't like my complexion had worsened. If anything, it had gotten better.\n\nI brushed off his comment and asked him a casual question.\n\n\"How was your break?\"\n\n\"It was alright, I guess. Nothing much happened. Just visited some distant relatives.\"\n\n\"Hmm? Didn't you say you were an orphan last time?\"\n\n\"So what if I'm an orphan? Can't orphans have relatives? I'm still human!\"\n\n\"That's not what I meant...\"\n\nAs far as I knew, he didn't have any living relatives.\n\nMaybe I was mistaken.\n\nAs I pondered this, his incessant grumbling interrupted my thoughts.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right, our dear noble wouldn't even consider a common orphan to be human, would he? It's so unfair! In my next life, I'm definitely going to be born a noble...\"\n\n\"Just shut up already.\"\n\n\"Oh my~ You should listen to our Young Master, you know?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nHad he lost his mind over the break?\n\nMy forehead throbbed.\n\nI pinched the bridge of my nose before raising my hand high in the air.\n\nAnd then, I brought it down swiftly.\n\nMy target, of course, was Golden Boy's back.\n\n-SMACK!!\n\nA resounding crack echoed through the air.\n\nGolden Boy's body went rigid.\n\nHis jaw dropped, and his eyes widened.\n\nA moment later, his signature shriek pierced the air.\n\n\"Argh!!\"\n\nHe jumped up as if he had been burned.\n\nBut I wasn't done yet. I swung my hand a few more times.\n\n-SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!\n\nWith each satisfying thud, Golden Boy flinched.\n\n\"Ow! Ow!! Okay, okay, I'll stop messing around, just stop hitting me!!\"\n\nWhy was he whining?\n\nHe knew he was going to get beaten up anyway.\n\nI was determined to teach him a lesson for provoking me and then chickening out.\n\n\"Gah!\"\n\nSo noisy.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."

      "content": "***\n\nA few hours later.\n\nAt the training grounds near the Academy's main building.\n\nI was having a light spar with Golden Boy in this familiar place after almost three months.\n\nYou might be wondering why.\n\nI had been cooped up in the mansion all break, and my body was stiff.\n\nAnd since I had a personal punching bag right here... I figured I might as well get some exercise.\n\nThe sound of fists cutting through the chilly air filled the air.\n\n-Whoosh!\n\nA fist came flying towards me.\n\nI dodged it effortlessly with a simple turn of my head.\n\n\"Tsk... You're annoyingly good at dodging!\"\n\nGolden Boy clicked his tongue in frustration.\n\nDespite his string of failed attacks, he continued to press forward relentlessly.\n\nI maintained a safe distance, calmly countering his moves.\n\nNormally, I would have kept him at bay with long-range sword attacks.\n\nBut this spar was different.\n\nWe weren't using weapons.\n\nIt was a pure hand-to-hand combat spar.\n\nCreating distance was not a good idea, especially when your opponent was a brute like Golden Boy.\n\n\"Come on, take a hit!!\"\n\nHe lunged forward, his movements exaggerated.\n\nAt first glance, it seemed like he was losing his cool and attacking recklessly. But that was a trap.\n\nIf I mistook it for an opening and attacked, he would catch me off guard and throw me to the ground.\n\nDespite his appearance, Golden Boy was quite clever.\n\nOur spars were always a battle of wits.\n\nThis time, however, I saw through his plan.\n\n\"Haaah!\"\n\nI let out a loud yell, pretending to attack with my fist.\n\nI saw the corner of his lips twitch as he assumed he had me right where he wanted me. But that was just another feint.\n\nMy real attack wasn't my fist.\n\nIt was the roundhouse kick I had been setting up this whole time.\n\n-WHAM!\n\nMy kick landed squarely on his abdomen.\n\n\"Oof...!!\"\n\nGolden Boy let out a gasp and stumbled backward.\n\nHe staggered for a moment before collapsing to his knees.\n\n\"Ugh, I give... Urgh...\"\n\nHe admitted defeat.\n\nI took a moment to catch my breath.\n\nAs I wiped the sweat from my forehead, I heard his voice, weak and defeated.\n\n\"Ugh... You're a beast... Your physical abilities are something else...\"\n\nHe looked utterly pathetic.\n\nIt was strange.\n\nHe seemed weaker than the last time we sparred...\n\nMaybe something was wrong.\n\n\"Are you feeling alright?\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"I could tell. So, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Well~ If I told you your lifespan just got shortened by about 1,000 years, would you believe me?\"\n\n\"Stop being ridiculous...\"\n\nHe clearly didn't want to tell me.\n\nAnd I couldn't force him to.\n\nI sat down next to him.\n\nHe was lying sprawled on the ground when he suddenly asked,\n\n\"By the way... Did you get hurt during that incident?\"\n\n\"That incident?\"\n\nHe was talking about the Academy invasion that had occurred right before the break.\n\nI gave him an incredulous look.\n\n\"You're asking me that now...? After three months?\"\n\n\"Well~ We haven't seen each other since then, have we?\"\n\nHe scratched his head sheepishly.\n\n\"You didn't even ask if I was okay.\"\n\n\"I didn't need to.\"\n\n\"Why not?!\"\n\n\"Because I know what you're capable of. I doubt you'd die in a little skirmish like that.\"\n\n\"Oh... Well, when you put it that way...\"\n\n\"Don't get cocky.\"\n\nHe stared at me with what seemed like gratitude.\n\nI shoved him lightly and stood up.\n\nI had been at the training grounds for three hours. It was time to head back.\n\nThe others would be waiting for me at the dormitory.\n\nAnd after I unpacked, I needed to check if Margaret had arrived safely.\n\n\"I'll be going then.\"\n\n\"See ya.\"\n\nHe waved me off.\n\nI found his carefree demeanor irritating, but I didn't have time to argue.\n\nAs I turned to leave, he called out to me.\n\n\"Oh, right... Maniac!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You're coming to the thing next week, right?\"\n\n\"Thing?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you forgot.\"\n\nForgot what?\n\nI had just arrived at the Academy. I hadn't received any announcements yet.\n\nI stared at him blankly.\n\nHe sat up and spoke, his usual playfulness replaced with a somber expression.\n\n\"Next weekend... There's going to be a memorial service for the victims of the attack.\"\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nVictims.\n\nI hadn't allowed myself to think about that word.\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat.\n\nChoose your tier by clicking the 'Support me' button!\n\nRate and review this novel on NU to help people find this novel."
